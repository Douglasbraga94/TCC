AB Our Computer science k-12 education research group the educational toy company Quercetti have been collaborating together to design and manufacture toys that help stimulate and consolidate so-called computational thinking. This approach has been inspired by methods already consolidated in the literature and widespread worldwide such as the Bebras tasks and CS-Unplugged. This paper describes two of these smart toys, their design process, some evaluation's results, and finally feedback and reviews from buyers. The main activities proposed by these toys leverage visual coding through small colored physical items (e.g., pegs and balls) to deliver the unplugged activities to young users.

AB Within the field of social reintegration and re-education, this paper presents an educational experience carried out at the Iquitos Penitentiary Center, Lima, Peru, with the aim of providing an introduction to informatics to 25 inmates who volunteered to take part in the project. Twenty students and a teacher from the Scientific University of the South also in Peru, were responsible for initiating the transmission of knowledge from the university to inmates, with the collaboration and participation of the penitentiary coordinator. The main objectives of the case study were to validate both the suitability of the CS unplugged proposal and the adaptability of the L2T2L pedagogic strategy to the transmission of knowledge to adults, specifically penitentiary inmates. This strategy had been originally designed to transmit informatics knowledge from university to primary school. The validity and effectiveness of the experience was assessed using surveys. Results confirm that inmates achieved a good level of understanding when endeavoring to resolve most of the CS unplugged assignments designed for them. It was also seen that L2T2L is adaptable and valid for different scenarios other than those for which it was initially designed. Indeed, it was proven to be valid for transmitting knowledge to the prison population. Finally, it should be pointed out that the experience is easily replicable and that it brings an opportunity to introduce informatics into education programs in prisons, something which can contribute enormously to social reintegration and re-education, facilitating the subsequent reentry of inmates into the community once their period of imprisonment has ended.

AB With CS Unplugged activities, children all across the world can learn fundamental CS concepts without the requirement of learning how to program first. In the target article, the authors show the connection between CS Unplugged, on the one hand, and constructionism and computational thinking, on the other hand. They do so by providing a mapping between three CS Unplugged activities, Papert's constructionism, and six elements characterizing computational thinking. Here we reflect on what computational thinking is, how it is related to CS Unplugged, and how the CS Unplugged approach can be deepened in order to explore the full potential of constructionism.

AB This paper introduces an educational method for programming languages, applying the CS Unplugged concept. CS Unplugged is a methodology of teaching information science without using any computers through its educational steps, and it is said to be effective in teaching information science. We made a CS Unplugged-based lesson plan for an image processing algorithm using the Java language. The plan includes the following steps. First, a paper-and-pencil game activity is conducted without using any computers (CS Unplugged-step). Second, the paper-and-pencil game is simulated on Web browsers of computers using Java applets (CS Plugged-step). Third, the image processing procedure is described using natural language. Then, a flowchart of the procedure is drawn, and finally Java source code is written. We applied this method to students of a national institute of technology.

AB We teach computer programming to students aged 17 through 18 years. The course is structured into two units, with the first and second term each consisting of two 90-minute sessions per week conducted over 30 weeks. The course combines lectures with practical exercises. Every year we conduct a survey following the first term of two 90-minute sessions per week held over 30 weeks. The survey's results show that not a few students consider themselves to have insufficient understanding of programming or think that they are not good at programming. In response, we adopted and implemented a part of the Computer Science Unplugged (CS Unplugged) method, which is considered an effective way of teaching information science. However, although CS Unplugged has generated considerable results in motivating students to learn and in initial learning, we feel that it is not sufficiently connected to full-fledged programming languages such as C and Java. Accordingly, we propose a new method of advancing from CS Unplugged to full-fledged programming. The proposed method begins with conducting a CS Unplugged activity, and then continues on to the writing of a program on the same theme and further to its abstraction in Java. In this paper, we describe the thinking and concepts behind this proposed method.

AB Computer Science (CS) Unplugged activities have been deployed in many informal settings to present computing concepts in an engaging manner. To justify use in the classroom, however, it is critical for activities to have a strong educational component. For the past three years, we have been developing and refining a CS Unplugged curriculum for use in middle school classrooms. In this paper, we describe an assessment that maps questions from a comprehensive project to computational thinking (CT) skills and Bloom's Taxonomy. We present results from two different deployments and discuss limitations and implications of our approach.

AB Computer Science (CS) unplugged is a set of learning activities designed to explain CS concepts without using a computer. These activities have been used globally especially during CS outreach programs. It was used during these programs to attract middle and high school students to major in CS. With this knowledge in mind, we initiated a summer camp program involving local middle and high school girls using newly developed CS unplugged activities. The aim of these activities was to teach and simplify key programming concepts; we named these activities Programming Unplugged (PU). The set of activities developed focused on simplifying programming for newcomers. We had measured the success of the activities and the camp using surveys, and projects developed by the students. The result shows that the students have enjoyed the camp and will likely recommend it to their friends. Also, we noticed that most of the CS concepts introduced during PU activities were used in the student's projects.

ID VIEWPOINT
AB Context. The meaning and implications of "computational thinking" (CT) are only now starting to be clarified, and the applications of the Computer Science (CS) Unplugged approach are becoming clearer as research is appearing. Now is a good time to consider how these relate, and what the opportunities and issues are for teachers using this approach. Problem. The goal here is to connect computational thinking explicitly to the CS Unplugged pedagogical approach, and to identify the context where Unplugged can be used effectively. Method. We take a theoretical approach, selecting a representative sample of CS Unplugged activities and mappingthem to CT concepts. Results - The CS Unplugged activities map well onto commonly accepted CT concepts, although caution must be taken not to regard CS Unplugged as being a complete approach to CT education. Canstructivist content. A constructivist approach to teaching computer science concepts can be particularly valuable at present because the public (and many teachers who are likely to have to become engaged with the subject) do not see CS as something they are likely to understand. Providing a clear way for anyone to construct this knowledge for themselves gives an opportunity to empower them when it might otherwise have been regarded as a domain that is open to only a select few.

AB Due to its great importance in the media, the start-up world and the political discussion, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly relevant as a topic for schools. Until now, approaches to making AI tangible for students without actually programming an AI system have been rare. To address this circumstance, a teaching sequence of unplugged activities about AI has been developed and is presented. AI Unplugged provides CS Unplugged activities that present the ideas and concepts of computer science without using computers. The activities shed light on important concepts of AI and make it possible to convey the central ideas of artificial intelligence to the students. In addition, they offer starting points for discussing social issues around AI. This article describes the activities and their theoretical background, outlines a possible course of instruction, and describes practical experiences with AI Unplugged.

AB An intervention using the unplugged programming and storytelling (UPS) strategy was implemented in this study to cultivate students' programming learning motivation and concepts. The participants were 49 second graders at a primary school in southern Taiwan. The course was conducted for 12 lessons (40 min each lesson). A quasi-experimental design was employed in this study. During the course, students in the experimental group were taught using the UPS strategy. Data collection included the Programming Concept Test and Programming Learning Motivation Scale supplemented by classroom observation and interview data. The results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the comparison group in programming learning motivation and concepts after the course with the UPS strategy. This teaching experiment obtained large effect sizes. Interviews showed that students perceived positively, which helped them develop their programming concepts. The implication is that the UPS strategy may contribute to primary school programming courses.

AB Magic tricks based on computer science concepts help grab student attention and can motivate them to delve more deeply. Error detection ideas long used by computer scientists provide a rich basis for working magic; probably the most well known trick of this type is one included in the CS Unplugged activities. This paper shows that much more powerful variations of the trick can be performed, some in an unplugged environment and some with computer assistance. Some of the tricks also show off additional concepts in computer science and discrete mathematics.

AB Integrating computer science (CS) into school curricula has become a worldwide preoccupation. Therefore, we present a CS and Robotics integration model and its validation through a large-scale pilot study in the administrative region of the Canton Vaud in Switzerland. Approximately 350 primary school teachers followed a mandatory CS continuing professional development program (CPD) of adapted format with a curriculum scaffolded by instruction modality. This included CS Unplugged activities that aim to teach CS concepts without the use of screens, and Robotics Unplugged activities that employed physical robots, without screens, to learn about robotics and CS concepts. Teachers evaluated positively the CPD and their representation of CS improved. Voluntary adoption rates reached 97% during the CPD and 80% the following year. These results combined with the underpinning literature support the generalisability of the model to other contexts.

AB Computational Thinking is one of the necessary skills for children who live in modern times. Therefore, in this research, we aim to design lesson that can cultivate Computational Thinking. In this research, design a lesson that cultivates Computational Thinking by moving a robot to the specified finger state using a finger robot. At that time the children can know that by using the notion of "binary" you can count many numbers by bending and extending your fingers. By using a finger robot, it is thought that children will motivate themselves to teach and to understand easily.

AB Introducing computational thinking at elementary school can develop students' capabilities and interest in Computing skills. In this study, we introduced the Computer Science unplugged (CS-unplugged) technique in Pakistan. We use paper-based activities to equip students with basic Computer Science skills without introducing any programming language. This study contributes twofold: First, we report the impact of CS-Unplugged training on more than 350 elementary students. The empirical study reveals that the students perform better in solving problems after unplugged training. Improved results in the post-training activity support this impact. Second, we applied machine learning to predict students' performance. We employed different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the students' performance. Our results indicate that the Logistic regression-based model can predict the positive response of the student with a 0.91 receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). This pilot study results encourage introducing unplugged techniques at elementary schools in third-world countries. The goal is to have minimal changes in infrastructure and focus on better student learning. In the future, we plan to introduce more unplugged problem-solving techniques to elementary students by providing little training to the science or math teacher.

AB This special session explores the use of magic tricks based on computer science ideas; magic tricks help grab students' attention and can motivate them to invest more deeply in underlying CS concepts. Error detection ideas long used by computer scientists provide a particularly rich basis for working such "magic", with a CS Unplugged parity check activity being a notable example. Prior work has shown that one can perform much more sophisticated tricks than the relatively well-known CS Unplugged activity, and these tricks can motivate analyses across a wide variety of computer science concepts and are relevant to learning objectives across grade levels from 2nd grade through graduate school. These tricks have piqued the interest of past audiences and have been performed with the aid of online implementations; this conference session will demonstrate enhanced implementations used to illuminate the underlying concepts rather than just to perform the tricks. The audience will participate in puzzling out how to apply relevant concepts as we work through a scaffolded series of tricks centering on error detection and correction. The implementations also provide a useful model for incorporating greater interaction than is typically found in current innovative online interactive textbooks. In addition, they are samples for possible programming assignments that can motivate students using CS Unplugged activities to actively pursue deep programming experiences.

AB Children and adolescents consume increasing hours of screen time, the largest share of which goes to viewing movies according to Common Sense Research. Recently, movies with the highest box office revenues typically feature computer-generated imagery (CGI). Despite this substantial consumption of computer-generated imagery, the typical young viewer is unaware of how large a role mathematics plays in creating these movies. Studies have shown that there is a link between proficiency in math and predicted success in computing. In this paper, we describe our efforts to develop and evaluate CS Unplugged and code-based activities that attempt to explicitly connect math concepts with the creation of movie special effects magic. The learning activities have been designed and evaluated with middle school and first-year college students to demonstrate their potential to increase awareness and knowledge of how math is used in movie effects and to increase desire for future study of math. The paper describes the motivating context, pedagogical strategies, math learning outcomes, and CS Unplugged and code-based activities so that others may apply the methods. The paper concludes with a presentation and analysis of results from a five-day STEM summer camp for middle-school children and activities presented in first-year college classrooms and discussion of limitations and directions for future work.

ID PERCEPTIONS
AB Many students hold incorrect views of what computer science (CS) is, and they have negative attitudes towards the field. In order to address these difficulties, a series of learning activities called Computer Science Unplugged was developed by Bell et al. [3]. These activities expose young people to central concepts in CS in an entertaining way, without requiring a computer. Using questionnaires and interviews, we examined the effect of the activities on middle-school students' views of CS, specifically, on their views of: (a) the nature of CS; (b) the characteristics of computer scientists and work in CS; (c) the variety of employment in CS. The results indicate that-although the students generally understood what CS is-they perceived the computer as the essence of CS and not primarily as a tool, contrary to the intention of the CS Unplugged activities. We suggest additions to the activities intended to increase the change in the views of CS that students have.

Our approach focuses on distilling the essence of computer science topics while tailoring their content and delivery methods to suit the younger audience. We describe our efforts and report on our experiences implementing our framework for eight primary school classes, turning our unplugged computer science workshops for secondary school classes into an educational playground for 192 primary school children. Our work contributes to the general societal mission of supporting more and more children to become interested in STEM, ensuring that our technological future is as diverse as possible.

AB Quantum computing is aninterdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science, and finds applications in areas including optimization, machine learning, and simulation of chemical, physical, and biological systems. It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9-12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.

AB Programming skills are an important component of an engineering curriculum, not only because they enable the customization of software tools to be used in the profession, but also (and perhaps more crucially) because of the "computational thinking" and problem solving capabilities that are ideally developed by young students who learn to program for the first time. The necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in Computer Science (CS)) it is well-documented in literature [1], as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org. This work presents an educational approach to teaching initial programming based on the development of fundamental and transversal skills and computer science skills, including creative and computational thinking as well as problem solving and critical thinking. The approach is based on cutting-edge educational tools, namely the visual programming frameworks Scratch, AppInventor, BYOB, and the well-known C/C++ language; curriculum material is drawn from CSPrinciples pilot courses, CS unplugged, school level preparation material for the International Olympiad in Informatics, and are complemented by supplementary information. The pedagogical approaches used in the course are based on constructivist learning theory, experiential learning and guided inquiry. This paper presents a year-long teaching experience in a 10th/13th grade high school with 14 to 16-year-old students. Ways to extend the experience to a university course are also presented. An initial analysis of the course results, both qualitative (based on two student surveys) and quantitative (based on formal written examinations) is presented and discussed. Results are encouraging, showing how visual programming languages help students to improve their problems solving skills and reasoning practices. Exposing the younger generation to computational concepts is fundamental in order to improve the mastering of these concepts and increase the success rate in university studies.

DE education; computer science unplugged; program counter
AB Computer science unplugged (CS unplugged) is a method of teaching computer science and computational thinking. The aim of our study is to illustrate program behavior and to prevent confusion about the program stack through visualization. To facilitate recognition, we used a toy consisting of a ball, pipes, and magnetic panels. The ball represents which line of code is executed, similar to the program counter. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present three examples based on the proposed method. The examples are necessity of loop to wait user input, necessity of loop to keep program running, and software testing. We conducted an experiment with nine participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result suggested that the proposed method is expected to be effective.

AB Educational Robotics (ER) has the potential to provide significant benefits to education, provided an increase in outreach by transitioning from the extra-curricular initiatives in which ER has thrived to formal education. As Computer Science (CS) Education is undergoing curricular reforms worldwide, the present study addresses the case of a Digital Education reform that included ER as a means to teach core CS concepts. Approximately 350 teachers from the first four grades of primary school participated in a mandatory two-year continuing professional development (CPD) program. The first year of the program was dedicated to CS and introduced teachers to CS Unplugged (CSU) and Robotics Unplugged (RU) activities. As such, we analyse the interplay between these activities and focus on teachers' voluntary adoption of the proposed content in classrooms. This is complemented by an analysis of their perception and recommendation of ER. The findings highlight three main points. Firstly, ER benefits from the integration in the CS CPD, as this provides the necessary traction to introduce ER into teacher practices (the teachers freely devoted 2275 h to ER activities in their classrooms, over two years). Secondly, the presence of ER activities in the CS-CPD allows a higher proportion of teachers to adopt the CS content, as there are teachers that favour one type of activity over the other. Finally, the globally positive perception of ER registered in this study is relevant for two reasons: teachers were not voluntarily participating in the CPD, and results did not differ between pioneers and novices.

DE diversity; K-12 education; outreach; assessment
AB The desire to expose more students to computer science has led to the development of a plethora of educational activities[16, 7, 15, 4] and outreach programs to broaden participation in computer science. Despite extensive resources (time and money), they have made little impact on the diversity of students pursuing computer science. To realize large gains, computational thinking must be integrated into K-12 systems, starting with elementary school. In order to do so, existing resources need to be adapted for a school setting.
   In order to make a curriculum with lessons that build on each other over several years, and accountability for student learning, we need standards, an understanding of how students learn, and identification of what students know before exposure to the curriculum.
   In this paper, we present our detailed findings of what fourth graders know before encountering a computational thinking curriculum. Groups of students participated in activities modified from CS Unplugged[4] in order to discover their knowledge (rather than provide instruction). We identify aspects of the activities students were able to complete successfully, and where they will need further instruction. We then explain how we used these results to modify our pilot curriculum.

AB Contribution: Adaptation and application of a methodology to introduce Informatics from an early age to students living in disadvantaged areas in Peru and analysis of its effects.Background: On the on hand, during the COVID-19 pandemic, students living in disadvantaged areas in Peru were confined to their home under the supervision of their family and without access to computers. On the other hand, the multistage sequencing knowledge transmission methodology (L2T2L), first proposed in JolasMATIKA (Basque Country), to introduce Informatics topics using CS Unplugged from university to school had shown to be effective.Research Question: Does the introduction from an early age into Informatics affect the appreciation of students living in disadvantaged areas about what Informatics is and their attitude toward it? Is the methodology used appropriate for times of pandemic?Methodology: A pilot project based on the L2T2L methodology was introduced at the Public School of the Religious Association Br. Thomas Helm S.M. (Peru) for primary and secondary education during the 2020/2021 pandemic academic year. University engineering students from the UTEC University were in charge of initiating the transmission of Informatics concepts to teachers of secondary and primary education who transmitted the knowledge to their respective students, using mobile phones. Surveys were used to gather data at the beginning and the end of the experience.Findings: A methodology adequate for introducing Informatics from an early age and for reducing the digital divide between technologically advanced communities and more disadvantaged communities. Students and family unit members changed their opinion about Informatics.

AB Quantum computing is an emerging field that can revolutionize our ability to solve problems and enable breakthroughs in many areas including optimization, machine learning, chemistry, and drug design. With the increasing computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing increases significantly. The theory of quantum computing lies at the crossroads of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. The field of quantum computing has matured and can now be explored by all students. While today, quantum computers and simulators are readily accessible and programmable over the internet, quantum computing education is just ramping up. This paper describes our experiences in organizing and delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students with little or no experience in the above-mentioned fields. We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed "unplugged" activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. Overall, we take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Q Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our experiences and findings suggest that basic quantum computing concepts are palatable for high-school students, and-due to significant differences between classical and quantum computing-early exposure to quantum computing is a valuable addition to the set of problem-solving and computing skills that high-schoolers obtain before entering university.

AB First-order logic (FO) is an important foundation of many domains, such as mathematics, philosophy, computer science and artificial intelligence. Currently, there is a growing interest in teaching computer science concepts and computational thinking to children, such as through Scratch [5], Blockly [3] or CS Unplugged [1]. One topic which appears to be curiously understudied, however, is that of teaching of FO. Indeed, FO is not only important in CS and AI, but learning FO can also help children in a variety of other disciplines by sharpening their reasoning skills. While Kowalski and colleagues already saw the potential of teaching Prolog in 1980 [4], not many tools or applications have been published for teaching any form of logic since then. This is due to a number of issues that may make teaching FO difficult: (1) logic has a steep learning curve, (2) it does not "do" anything, and (3) it is not fun due to the lack of graphics, animations and sounds. In our work, we overcome these objections by designing an appropriate learning environment. The focus of this environment is twofold: a child-friendly representation for FO, combined with a fun and engaging task to solve.

AB Being able to teach students about CS concepts effectively is a growing priority in primary schools. Teachers need to develop not just their content knowledge but also best-practice pedagogical approaches. Direct observation is one way of evaluating new teaching methods, but research with video/screen capture is typically time-consuming and difficult to get quick insights from. In this study we explore using 3D virtual worlds to quickly collect richer information from students working on an educational activity in a simulated 3D environment such as Second Life.
   We report on a case study exploring the insights that could be gleaned from this data collection, and compare how students learned in a 3D virtual world with simpler 2D map-based versions of a CS Unplugged problem-solving activity. The activity chosen was initially designed for physical use, and did not intrinsically favour either computer-based environment.
   Students using the 2D condition found a non-optimal solution faster, but the amount of extra time taken to find the optimal solution was similar to the 3D condition, and students had similar post-test scores in both conditions. Students using the 3D condition appeared to choose their actions more carefully, reflecting the higher physical load and slower response times of the virtual world environment. More students thought the 3D activity was fun and would choose to do again, and reported that it felt more like they were learning.
   While authoring tools are improving, virtual world content can still be challenging to develop and deploy. Care is needed to design engaging activities, and avoid creating environments that are immersive but a poor fit for learning.

AB Intrinsic Motivation Inventory is a self-report instrument used to assess participants' experience regarding a particular activity. This paper examined the psychometric properties of a revised Intrinsic Motivation Inventory in the context of computational thinking learning. A total of 400 students from 4th grade participated in the pilot study. The revised instrument measured students' intrinsic motivation from four dimensions: interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, value/usefulness, and relatedness. The main findings of the study are twofold: (1) primary school students showed moderate to high motivation to learn computational thinking through programming and CS Unplugged; (2) factor analysis revealed that single factor model and multifactor model had good fit indices. However, discriminant validity of multifactor model was poor, suggesting the existence of a general factor.

   Diffie-Hellman key exchange
AB In today's technology-dominated world, in order to better equip the next generation of youth with technological skills suitable for future jobs, pre-tertiary and early tertiary curricula are being significantly revamped all over the world. In line with this drive, as a STEM discipline, Computer Science (CS) is also being widely incorporated in recent curricular initiatives. Information security is one of core areas of CS. Security concepts often entail esoteric mathematical ideas which are difficult to explain to early-stage learners, which necessitates contriving new and engaging ways of teaching. This paper deals with teaching of one such security concept - namely, Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol - to early-stage learners. Traditionally, a color-mixing analogy has been used for introducing the concept of Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Although this approach elegantly exemplifies the discrete logarithm problem on which the protocol is based, depending on how the lesson is executed, it can be passive, or require a new supply of liquid colors for each lesson. Therefore, we have developed a digital version of the color-mixing approach - while retaining active student participation and tangibility - by using color sensors and Raspberry Pi. We also propose a mission-based lesson plan based on the tangible tool for enabling young pupils to comprehend difficult concepts. Our pilot study using the tangible-tool-based lesson plan showed promising results as the participants found the lesson engaging and enriching. We also believe, as an unplugged approach, our low-cost and reusable tangible tool can help ensure universal access to education in developing countries.

AB In order to meet the cybersecurity workforce demand, it is important to raise cybersecurity interest among the youth. Just like ACM programming competitions, Capture the Flag ( CTF) competitions allow students to learn cybersecurity skills in a fun and engaging way. It is an effective platform to increase students' interest in cybersecurity and prepare them for defending against real cyber attackers. A typical CTF competition requires at least some basic technical security knowledge and months of diligent preparation. For this very reason, many computer science students do not feel qualified to participate in CTF competitions, and as a result, do not even try. To overcome this lack of confidence while at the same time raising awareness about the cybersecurity profession in a realistic fashion, we have developed the CTF Unplugged project, as inspired by the CS Unplugged project. The primary goal is to teach students with little or no technical knowledge about the different cybersecurity challenges that a cybersecurity professional must address and the problem-solving skills needed for a cybersecurity career, all without direct use of technology. The effectiveness of CTF unplugged project has been evaluated after exposing 36 high school students participating in the Tennessee Tech University GenCyber Camp to these activities this past summer. Students reported a significant gain in knowledge, confidence and comfort level after participation.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB With the introduction of Computer Science (CS) into curricula worldwide, researchers have investigated whether CS could be introduced transversally, as a support other disciplines. Few however consider both student learning and the teachers' perspective in their assessments. In a co-constructive approach to translational research, we collaborated with teachers, in two case studies involving two classes each, to investigate how CS content could be used transversally. More specifically, teacher inputs and student learning data were combined in a mixed methods analysis to determine whether two CS Unplugged (CSU) activities from the curriculum could be leveraged to teach disciplinary content in primary school. The findings indicated that the CSU activities could be leveraged for maths and spelling, but require validation at a larger scale. More important, though, are the takeaways of the co-constructive experience with teachers. Interestingly the benefits of co-construction went both ways. While researchers gained a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the activities, teachers i) appreciated having detailed student learning analyses, devoid of biases and impressions, ii) changed their perspective about researchers, and iii) were open to other collaborative research initiatives which they found to be drivers of change and innovation in their practice. The way co-construction was approached also impacted the teachers' perception of their experience. Indeed, while one study was researcher-driven and included teachers, the other was teacher-driven and included researchers. When teacher-driven, the teachers felt they had a more active role, thus reflecting more on the study design, results and implications. Provided the positive impact that co-construction may have on innovation in teacher practices, different co-construction modalities must be investigated, as well as their implications on all stakeholders, including researchers.

ID ECOLOGY
AB This experience report describes an approach for helping elementary schools integrate computational thinking and coding by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure that do not rely on 1-1 computing. A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon "unplugged" knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by pre-and post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations.

ID EFFICACY
AB The integration of practice-related aspects in pre-service informatics teacher education is an essential part in future teachers' qualifications. To further promote opportunities for teaching-practice into our teacher-preparation programs, we recently introduced a teaching-learning-laboratories (TLL) for informatics in Karlsruhe, Germany. This TLL not only offers pre-service informatics teachers students the opportunity to gain practical teaching experience, but we also promote competencies of secondary school pupils in workshops for school classes. In the laboratory, pre-service informatics teacher students can practice in micro-teaching learning scenarios both in seminars and in workshops with school classes. Based on this, we developed teaching-learning strategies as a combination of unplugged and plugged teaching-learning activities. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the workshops, they are also subject of an evaluation, examining the TLL from the perspective of the workshop concepts for pre-service informatics teacher students and the schools' pupils. From these two perspectives we investigate different fields of interest with the common goal to establish an effective TLL. In this paper we describe our approach of the TLL, our first experiences with workshops we have already conducted as well as the framework and the concept for evaluation.

   Unplugged; K-12 education
AB In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.
   It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.
   In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner's mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner's mental model to a full NM.

DE education; unplugged; semantic waves; teacher professional development
AB We apply the notion of 'semantic waves' from Legitimation Code Theory (LCT), a powerful educational framework, to Computer Science Education. We consider two case studies exploring how a simple analysis can help improve learning activities. The case studies focus on unplugged activities used in the context of both teaching school students and teacher continuing professional development. We used a simple method based on LCT to analyse the activities in terms of their 'semantic profiles': changes in the context-dependence and complexity of the knowledge being taught. This led to improvements to the activities. We argue that 'semantic waves', or moves back and forth between concrete/simpler and abstract/complex knowledge, help show ways that an unplugged activity might be effective or not, and how small changes to the activities can make a difference in potentially offering a more fruitful learning experience.

AB The demand to incorporate informatics into primary education is seen as a critical necessity both today, and for the future of modern societies. Numerous countries are currently revising their primary education curricula in order to incorporate informatics concepts and computational thinking skills. Although many successful initiatives have been implemented, countries commonly encounter shared obstacles related to teacher competence development, concept selection, learning content design, and the pedagogical approaches employed. This study explored the effectiveness of three pedagogical approaches on primary school students' learning of informatics concepts. Mixed-method research with a concurrent embedded design in the form of a quasi-experimental study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the three pedagogical approaches (two unplugged: role-play, hands-on, and one plugged: technology-mediated). A total of 55 fourth-grade students participated in the intervention where the instructional content focused on the core five concepts of informatics in primary school through 15 activities. Based on students' pretest and posttest results, as well as their reflections, unique advantages and drawbacks of the three pedagogical approaches were revealed. Gender differences according to the results, reflections, and pedagogical approaches were each investigated. Although variations were noted in task completion and reflective outcomes, it is a crucial to recognise that the effectiveness of any approach may be contingent upon other contextual factors. The findings of this study are significant in terms of the potential influence of various pedagogical approaches on future educational practices, as well as policies for instructional designers at the primary school level.

AB In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.

AB Circulatory system is a challenging subject for middle school students to learn and understand conceptual relationships. To address these challenges, this study developed plugged (computational thinking activities using computer) and unplugged (computational thinking activities without using computer) teaching modules that integrated computational thinking components into the circulatory system topic. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of these teaching modules on the conceptual learning and computational thinking skills of 6th grade students. A quasi-experimental design was employed with experimental group 1 using plugged instructional modules, experimental group 2 using unplugged instructional modules and the control group following an inquiry-based constructivist approach aligned with the Turkish science curriculum. These interventions were implemented over a period of 16 lesson hours (4 weeks) for all three groups. The researchers used the Circulatory System Conceptual Learning and Computational Thinking Skills Scale (CSCL-CTSS) as a data collection tool. The results of the study indicated that both experimental group 1 (n = 30) and experimental group 2 (n = 30) showed significantly higher success in circulatory system conceptual learning and computational thinking skills compared to the control group (n = 30). Therefore, this experimental study provides a concrete example of integrating computational thinking into science teaching and presents innovative educational approaches that can enhance the learning of challenging science concepts. Furthermore, it compares the effectiveness of these innovative educational approaches (plugged and unplugged implementations) in developing conceptual learning and computational thinking skills.

AB As conversational AI apps such as Siri and Alexa become ubiquitous among children, the CS education community has begun leveraging this popularity as a potential opportunity to attract young learners to AI, CS, and STEM learning. However, teaching conversational AI to K-12 learners remains challenging and unexplored due in part to the abstract and complex nature of some conversational AI concepts, such as intents and training phrases. One promising approach to teaching complex topics in engaging ways is through unplugged activities, which have been shown to be highly effective in fostering CS conceptual understanding without using computers. Research efforts are underway toward developing unplugged activities for teaching AI, but few thus far have focused on conversational AI. This experience report describes the design and iterative refinement of a series of novel unplugged activities for a conversational AI summer camp for middle school learners. We discuss learner responses and lessons learned through our implementation of these unplugged activities. Our hope is that these insights support CS education researchers in making conversational AI learning more engaging and accessible to all learners.

AB This study proposed plugged and unplugged approaches for young students to simultaneously improve their interdisciplinary learning performance in English and Computational Thinking (CT). The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students' English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students' foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach. This research provides an innovation development and evaluation for plugged and unplugged approaches.

AB We introduced "Computer Science Unplugged" to our classes in junior and senior high schools. "Unplugged" is an education method of computer science without students using a computer at all. For our classes, we developed original teaching materials and methods for Unplugged. As a result, the students could learn the topics of computer science with interest by using Unplugged. They enjoyed the games in Unplugged and thought about the topics deeply at the same time. We confirmed that students enhanced their motivations, thinking abilities, and imaginations.

AB Learning programming in early introductory classes is challenging for first year university students, and introducing parallel programming (PDC) in early classes along with traditional sequential programming is even more challenging. Unplugged activities may help alleviate some of the difficulties for students. Unplugged activities have been shown to increase student interest, and to enhance student understanding of CS programming concepts [1]. We have used unplugged activities to teach PDC concepts before introducing parallel programming. Our experiences show that using unplugged activities to introduce the PDC concepts reduce the barrier to learn parallel programming.

AB Technological devices programmed through parallel computing are increasingly present in people's daily lives. They are responsible for processing images that we see on computers, televisions, cell phones and games. It is a fact that parallel processing is a reality, so computer professionals need to know the peculiarities of this form of programming. However, teaching parallel computing is not a simple task, the computational thinking parallel is quite different from that for the sequential processing. This work, then proposes a new methodology for teaching parallel computing for young beginners in programming. Our technique is based on principles of unplugged computing, like to learn doing and playing. We believe that unplugged computing can be very useful in teaching the difficult concepts of parallel computing(1).

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB Informatics or computer science1 contents are often considered as "difficult", at school as well as in University courses. This may be due to different reasons, e.g. to the topics themselves or to the way of teaching. What can be done in order to make it easier to understand for students of all ages? This paper about an Austrian project for primary and secondary schools - "Informatics - A Child's Play" shows one possible way: the use of games, animations and simulations. The project is partly based on successful projects like "Computer Science Unplugged" or "Informatik erLeben (Experiencing Informatics)". Like these initiatives, it teaches computer science topics in a playful way, where children slip into the role of hardware components, parts of programs or data. But, the new project "Informatics - A Child's Play" goes further: New teaching units and material are developed and, this is the essential novelty, the children themselves design and test games, quizzes, puzzles and riddles. Furthermore, they act as peer tutors or peer teachers and explain different topics to their classmates, to younger children as well as to elderly people. This paper describes the project, which is still in the pilot phase, as well as some experiences and results gained up to now.

AB The aim of this study is to compare the effects of unplugged and plugged-in activities on academic achievement and computational thinking (CT) skills of sixth-grade students. Mixed-method research was carried out to explore whether there were differences between the groups, and to learn the students' opinions and experiences regarding the practices. For the quantitative phase, a quasi-experimental design was used with two groups. For qualitative phase, 12 students were interviewed. The participants were 84 sixth-grade students (between the ages of 10 and 11). The intervention was designed on a selection/construction of activities from seven different basic programming web platforms for the plugged-in group and the proposed national curriculum unplugged activities for the unplugged group. The results showed that significant differences between groups in academic achievement favoring the unplugged activities, but not in CT skills. Development in CT skills contributed to the unplugged group's academic achievement. In addition, qualitative results showed that the plugged-in group perceived their activities as fun and entertaining, but not exactly like a lesson; in contrast, the unplugged group did not experience anxiety or boredom since they perceived the activities as educational. CT explained 27 percent of the variance in academic achievement, suggesting that this skill is important for academic achievement in basic programming. These results suggest that students can improve their academic achievement and maintain the level of CT acquisition across unplugged and plugged-in activities. This article contributes to the body of knowledge about the positive impact of unplugged activities on teaching CT and programming fundamentals.

AB We present a learning path on cryptography for primary school students (Grade 5), which we designed and tested. The project aims to raise initial awareness of the core ideas of modern cryptography, which are fundamental concepts for becoming informed and active citizens in modern digital society. For this reason, we designed a progression of unplugged activities (sometimes integrated with task-specific, block-based programming environments) to expose students to different cryptographic techniques, where each new activity is motivated by an analysis of the criticalities encountered previously. We used unplugged activities to show that Computer Science (CS) does not necessarily imply the use of digital devices and to allow students to focus on its general scientific principles. We describe the designed learning module, discuss the main hinges in the experiment, and reflect on the lessons learned. The final evaluation showed excellent learning outcomes and high satisfaction with the activities. As cryptography uses mathematical tools (e.g., modular arithmetic, statistics), some parts of which are within reach of primary school children but rarely taught to them, it was possible to dwell on these aspects, making them experience mathematical objects in a non-standard context, and also stimulating a greater awareness of the impact of mathematics and CS in everyday life.

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB Technology has a deep impact on everyday life of most people today, and computing science, information and communication technologies, and digital media are finding their way to education, too. The use of technology and digital materials is, however, a matter of ongoing debate, and educators are called upon to decide whether and when to use digital materials or not. At the department of informatics didactics in Klagenfurt, we developed our own teaching approach and do have a rich experience in the use of unplugged and plugged activities in the classroom. This paper gives some background information about our learning approach and shows, through three examples, how digital materials can be introduced successfully at all levels of education, from elementary up to university level. It also shows that digital materials, when used appropriately, allow for broader methodological approach and stimulates more differentiated way of teaching.

AB To provide a unified view of any scientific field, outreach programs need to realistically portray the subject in question. Consequently, topics and methods actually taught in Computer Science courses should to be touched upon in Computer Science outreach programs or, conversely, elements from successful Computer Science outreach programs can be used to enrich established courses in Computer Science. We follow up on the latter aspect and investigate how outreach material might be used as a teaching resource in lower secondary Computer Science. In particular, we extract and classify learning objectives from the activities of the well-received Computer Science Unplugged program. Based upon this classification, we comment on where and to which extent these activities can be used to enrich teaching Computer Science in secondary education.

AB The increasing demand for technological professions has boosted STEAM education and the development of computational thinking from an early age. Although teaching programming is considered effective in fostering this type of thinking, it has been observed that focusing exclusively on coding in the short term may not be the most appropriate strategy. The aim of this work was to analyze empirical studies that deal with the development of computational thinking in students of different educational stages. For this purpose, a systematic review with meta-analysis methodology was used, where 12 studies conducted in educational stages from preschool to higher education were analyzed. Eleven of these studies reported significant evidence of learning computational thinking while only one of them found no significant differences. In turn, the overall effect size was significant in favour of the experimental group. Finally, this approach adapts to the needs of children, as it allows them to learn in a playful and creative way, fostering cognitive, logical, and problem- solving skills.

AB Children's preschool years are crucial for the development of computational thinking (CT) skills. However, debate continues regarding whether CT should be developed through plugged-in or unplugged activities. This study investigated the similarities and differences between plugged-in and unplugged activities with similar learning content and assessment methods for cultivating computational thinking (CT) in young children. Twenty-four young children (aged 5-6 years) from a kindergarten in Foshan, China, were randomly assigned to either the plugged-in or unplugged group to participate in a five-week study. In the plugged-in group, Dodobot was used in the classroom, while in the unplugged group, unplugged materials such as paper, pencil and tangram puzzles were used. Research results indicate that 1) both plugged-in and unplugged activities significantly improved the young children's CT skills after a short-term educational intervention, but there were no significant differences between the two groups; 2) the extent to which the plugged-in and unplugged activities promoted subdimensions of CT was different, with the plugged-in group demonstrating significant improvements in hardware, algorithm, and modularity and the unplugged group demonstrating significant improvements in terms of representation; 3) the children from both the plugged-in and unplugged groups showed high motivation; And 4) the children in both the plugged-in and unplugged groups showed cooperative behaviors. The frequency of cooperative behavior was more related to materials, and cooperation quality was more related to teacher guidance.

AB Teaching introductory computer science is gradually shifting from learning a computer programming language towards acquiring more generic computational thinking skills. At the same time, more emphasis is placed nowadays in natural and playful approaches that can potentially increase student motivation and engagement. One promising such approach is the combination of tangible elements with augmented reality technology, where the instructions can be given in the real world by manipulating physical elements, and the output is presented in a digitally enhanced space. Despite its potential, this approach has not yet been evaluated in formal educational settings. In this paper we present the results from a preliminary study in an elementary school that compared a tangible AR game with the same game in an unplugged version, to examine the effect of the interface on student motivation, effectiveness and teaching practice. The results indicate that a tangible AR approach can improve the engagement and collaboration of students in classroom activities and affects the role of the instructor compared to unplugged activities. The paper concludes with a number of open issues that need to be further studied.

AB In this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal STEM education workshops with young children. The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.

TI MathAIde: A Qualitative Study of Teachers' Perceptions of an ITS
   Unplugged for Underserved Regions

AB Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) possess significant potential to enhance learning outcomes. However, deploying ITSs in global south countries presents challenges due to their frequent lack of essential technological resources, such as computers and internet access. The concept of AIED Unplugged has emerged to bridge this digital divide, supporting the creation of theoretical frameworks for developing ITS unplugged. Nevertheless, prior research has not evaluated ITS unplugged with teachers, diminishing the importance of aligning technological solutions with their target users' practical requirements and viewpoints. This article addresses this gap by presenting the design and evaluation of an ITS unplugged for numeracy education. Through face-to-face usability tests and interviews with Brazilian primary education teachers, the study employs thematic analysis to understand teachers' perceptions profoundly. Results reveal that teachers value ITS unplugged for optimizing lesson planning, offering real-time error-specific feedback, providing learning analytics, and enabling personalized group learning within classrooms. Additionally, concerns about application size and internet dependency underscore important considerations for underserved regions. Such empirical evidence on teachers' perceptions bridges the gap between theoretical frameworks and real-world user perspectives, demonstrating that ITS unplugged can address educational disparities, provided it aligns with teachers' needs, technological limitations, and contextual factors. As educational technology evolves, comprehending the viewpoints of primary users becomes pivotal for equitable implementation. Therefore, this article represents a significant stride toward deploying AIED in the global south and other underserved regions. By combining theoretical concepts with practical user insights, ITS unplugged can be a transformative solution for education.

AB This paper investigates unplugged computing as a formal pedagogical strategy to teaching computing to a Maltese secondary class of Year 9 students. It aims at identifying the effectiveness of this pedagogy outlining the strengths and weaknesses in its application, taking into consideration the level of attainment for students, as well as the impact on teachers' lesson preparation. This research study is based on the delivery of five unplugged activities. It analyses students' reaction when exposed to such unplugged activities to assess the viability of using this pedagogy when teaching computing concepts in a formal setting. The study concludes that unplugged computing is an effective pedagogical strategy that helps attain a high level of engagement and student involvement, encouraging teamwork and collaboration. Students experience a wide attention span and good retention through the constant link of computing scenarios to reallife examples and the use of tangible non-computing related objects. Notwithstanding, the study also identifies certain limitations of this pedagogy, mainly that it is not sufficient as a standalone pedagogy, but needs to be applied in conjunction with other pedagogies to be able to cover all the expected learning objectives of the curriculum.

AB Recently, pedagogical approaches to promote computational thinking among 21st century learners have increasingly become a topic of interest in educational research. Studies revealed that unplugged computer programming, learning coding without a computer, can enhance students' computational thinking and positive attitudes towards computer programming. However, when dealing with complex computer science concepts, they face limitations. This study therefore developed a solution adopting unplugged coding using flowcharts integrated with Augmented Reality (AR) technology to help scaffold students (called AR semi-unplugged coding). It recruited 120 secondary students for data collection, divided into an experimental group and a control group (unplugged coding). It showed that although both exhibited improved computational thinking and increased self-efficacy after participating in their assigned activity, those in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts statistically. Moreover, the developed solution attracted a greater level of perceived usefulness by users which shows its potential to become an effective approach for promoting computational thinking.

AB Nowadays, it is not an easy way to motivate young people to learning Computer Science. Many times, we can hear in our country that employees working in the field of computer science are well-paid above the average. Nevertheless, there is still a deficiency and it does not cause enough motivation to learn this field. Sometimes just hearing "programming" is a demotivation itself. We would like to refuse the opinion that programming is not funny. In our mind, one of possible solutions could be robots which are able to be programmed through simple programming languages. Many researches show that using robots in the process of teaching programming increase motivation, logical and algorithmic thinking of students. The article deals with the programmable robot Phiro Unplugged PRO which is suitable for educational purposes within programming. Phiro Pro robot offers five different ways of programming depending on difficulty - simple sequential programming, swish cards, Scratch, Phiro Code, and Snap4Arduino. The article presents our experiences with using Phiro Pro Unplugged to teaching programming at our extracurricular activity at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica.

AB Changes to school curriculums increasingly require the introduction of computer science concepts to younger children. This practical report compares three existing tools for teaching computer science concepts: unplugged computing, tangible computing and MIT's Scratch. We specifically focus on the use of these tools for school pupils aged 5-7. We describe a comparative study with 28 pupils from three rural UK primary schools that explores engagement with, and effectiveness of, each tool. As far as we are aware this is the first such comparative study of its kind. We demonstrate that the studied tools can be used to successfully introduce core computer science concepts to pupils as young as 5 years of age, that the methods used by teachers to deliver computing curriculums may greatly impact the learning outcomes, and that particular care needs to be taken to ensure that pupils focus on learning concepts rather than learning tools.

AB In this work, we present a line of research focus on the didactics of teaching and learning of Computer Science for primary school. Our approach combines the training of teachers in Computational Thinking with Unplugged activities (without the use of computer) and Plugged ones, involving programming of computers and other devices. As a first instance of training, we presents the design and implementation of the "Higher Level Teaching Specialization in Didactics of Computer Science", approved by the Educational Ministry of Santa Fe, Argentine. The objective of this specialization is that the primary teachers can appropriate of Computational Thinking skills and the potential of programming, to include them in their educational practices in a contextualized, interdisciplinary and inclusive way. As results, an opinion poll is presented on a first stage of this training, from which it is possible to extract positive opinions of the teachers regarding the contents and didactics of the specialization that they are carrying out.

AB In this paper, we present an activity to introduce the idea of public -key cryptography and to make pre -service STEM teachers explore fundamental informatics and mathematical con cepts and methods. We follow the Theory of Didactical Situations within the Didactical Engineer ing methodology (both widely used in mathematics education research) to design and analyse a didactical situation about asymmetric cryptography using graphs. Following the phases of Didacti cal Engineering, after the preliminary analysis of the content, the constraints and conditions of the teaching context, we conceived and analysed the situation a priori, with a particular focus on the milieu (the set of elements students can interact with) and on the choices for the didactical vari ables. We discuss their impact on the problem -solving strategies the participants need to elaborate to decrypt an encrypted message. We implemented our situation and collected qualitative data. We then analysed a posteriori the different strategies that participants used. The comparison of the a posteriori analysis with the a priori analysis showed the learning potential of the activity. To elabo rate on different problem -solving strategies, the participants need to explore and understand several concepts and methods from mathematics, informatics, and the frontier of the two disciplines, also moving between different semiotic registers.

AB In the dynamic educational context of Malaysia, this study examines the impact of integrating Unplugged Activities (UA) with Block-Based Programming (BBP) on improving the computational thinking (CT) skills of secondary students in full boarding schools in Northern Peninsular Malaysia. Using a quasi-experimental design and mixed-methods analysis, the research evaluates the impact of these teaching methods on students' CT skills and attitudes toward programming. This research compares the results between a group that uses only BBP and another that combines both UA and BBP. The results indicate that CT skills improved in both groups, while students in the UA + BBP group showed more significant gains in confidence and a more positive attitude toward programming. These results provide valuable insights into pedagogical strategies within digital education and highlight the benefits of an integrated approach that combines tactile learning experiences with digital technologies. By combining hands-on activities with technology-based instruction, this approach not only deepens students' understanding of CT concepts but also positively changes their perception and engagement with programming.

AB Different instructional strategies have been drawn to assist elementary school students in improving computational thinking (CT) skills and student engagement (SE) in unplugged programming activities. This paper aimed to explore how the interactive strategies of unplugged programming affect CT skills and SE. The study was conducted based on a quasi-experimental research method. The sample was composed of 104 sixth-grade students from northern China. The students in the experimental group learned with interactive unplugged programming, whereas those in the control group learned with non-interactive unplugged programming. Analysis of Covariance statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling were adopted for data analysis. Results showed that the performance of the experimental group in CT skills and SE was considerably better than that of the control group. Moreover, the predictive relationships were more complex between CT skills and SE in the experimental group. In general, these findings confirmed the teaching value of interactive unplugged programming, and further emphasized the important role of students' CT skills in programming engagement. Therefore, through the application of interaction in instruction design, each student can be assigned a positive role to create a programming classroom that is more conducive to students.

AB There is a debate about the way to introduce computational thinking (CT) in schools. Different proposals are on the table; these include the creation of new computational areas for developing CT, the introduction of CT in STEM areas, and the cross-curricular integration of CT in schools. There is also concern that no student should be left behind, independently of their economic situation. To this effect, an unplugged approach is the most cost-effective solution. In addition, this topic is interesting in the context of a pandemic situation that has prevented the sharing of materials between students. This study analyzes an unplugged cross-curricular introduction of CT in the Social Sciences area among sixth grade students. A group of 14 students was selected to carry out an unplugged intervention design-where they were required to program an imaginary robot on paper-in the Social Sciences area. Their CT development and academic results were compared to those of 31 students from the control group who continued attending regular classes. Results showed that an unplugged teaching style of CT in Social Sciences lessons significantly increased CT (p < 0.001) and with a large effect size (d = 1.305) without differences in students' academic achievement. The findings show that children can potentially develop their CT in non-STEM lessons, learning the same curricular contents, and maintaining their academic results.

AB Several investigations state the low participation of women in the world of STEM. This fact implies a lack of feminine perspective in the solution to different problems. The school must provide teaching / learning strategies for the integration, empowerment, and active participation from early ages to work performance in STEM. This paper exposes two unplugged activities taken from a series of activities implemented with elementary students and families in Madrid, Spain. The general objectives are: To introduce and motivate interest from an early age in computer programming and the development of gender dynamics that educate about gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in this context.

AB Game-based approaches can be a motivating and engaging way of teaching and learning, in particular for younger students. To evaluate the suitability of game-based approaches for teaching programming in primary school, we conducted a field study on Computational Thinking (CT). CT can be characterized as the ability to understand, formulate, and systematically solve complex problems, which typically requires abstraction, generalization, parameterization, algorithmization, and partitioning as processes of CT, which are also vital to programming. The employed CT course focused on fostering students' conceptual understanding of computational thinking independent of specific technological applications and was based on course material from code. org. Lessons primarily addressed algorithms as a core CT concept and used game-based learning material to increase students' understanding of algorithmic CT concepts such as sequences, loops, branches, and events. These concepts were first introduced through unplugged game-based activities using tangible everyday objects (e.g. pencils, playing cards, etc.) instead of abstract code. In more advanced lessons, students' conceptual understanding was applied and deepened through plugged-in programming exercises. The 18 sessions (45 minutes each) of the course were taught to 33 3rd and 4th grade primary school students. At the end of unplugged lessons, students' understanding of newly introduced CT concepts was assessed by short tests. Students' interest in and motivation for programming education was measured with pre-and post-course self-assessment questionnaires. Results indicated benefits of the unplugged game-based approach for teaching CT concepts. In particular, we observed (a) for all but one of the CT concepts, students reached on average 82% of the learning objectives or more, and (b) students rated their learning experience in the course positively and reported high levels of interest in learning more about computation-related topics. In addition, qualitative analyses indicated part of the curriculum was very complex for the target group (e.g. nested conditionals). This finding is of particular interest for the development and evaluation of future programming courses for primary school students.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is one of the skills that are critical for problem-solving in a technology-driven society. Although the importance of CT as a goal in education is increasingly acknowledged, there is scant research on developing pre-service teachers' CT competencies so that they can integrate CT in their lesson design. In this study, drawing from the experiential learning framework, we discuss the design of a module using a novel approach that is a hybridisation of plugged and unplugged CT approaches. The aim is to facilitate pre-service teachers in making connections between CT and their teaching contexts. Thirty-eight pre-service teachers attended the CT module for twelve weeks. The results indicated that the participants developed better CT competencies by integrating, justifying and reflecting CT in their lesson design. This study demonstrates the importance of providing a practical CT module to conduct unplugged activities for pre-service teachers, especially for those without prior computing knowledge, before introducing CT in the context of programming.

AB For a number of years, various games have been used as an educational tool at different academic levels, especially in primary education. However, only recently games that teach coding and algorithmic thinking or even broader, computational thinking, emerged. Initiatives like Hour of Code and similar online activities or block-based programming games popularized the field, while at the same time, projects like CSU nplugged showed that the "idea of programming" can be learned even without using the computer. In this paper, we present our experience so far in creating and implementing different unplugged activities that teach students of different age levels, from early primary school to the university students, the simple programming concepts and algorithms. As a part of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (STEM-C) outreach program named SUZA - From school to science and the academic community at University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Croatia, we conducted a number of game-like activities based on graph paper programming, block-based programming and using the existing board games. Although this is a work in progress project, the participant reactions so far, collected through interviews and questionnaires, indicated that the conducted activities were well accepted by students and their teachers. We also received a number of useful feedback comments and proposals, such as to expand the activities to include the homework part, or to make them more physical and relocate them outdoors.

AB Despite recent high interest among researchers and practitioners in learning programming, even the most dedicated learners can struggle to find motivation for studying and practicing programming. Therefore, in recent years, several strategies (e.g., educational games, flipped classrooms, and visual programming languages) have been employed to increase students' engagement in programming studies. However, despite these efforts, no approach has proven efficient enough to sufficiently motivate these learners, and the community continues to search for novel strategies to enhance programming learners' motivation. Building upon this, our study explores the use of unplugged gamification (i.e., gamification implemented without digital technology) combined with challenge-based learning during a programming workshop. Using Grounded Theory methods and data collected from focus groups, we analyzed and interpreted the perceptions of 24 programming learners regarding the gamified workshop. Learners reported experiencing collaboration while learning, with some indicating increased effort to obtain rewards, while others seemed to forget about the rewards altogether. Our findings provide valuable insights for computing teachers and researchers into how unplugged gamification combined with challenge-based learning is perceived by programming learners.

AB By following the idea of not using computers at all, Computer Science Unplugged has set the course for many interactive, social, and hands-on activities dealing with concepts and problems of Computer Science Education. Through recent developments in immersive media, technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality could enhance such activities or even enable new ones. When providing immersive educational media that induce a sense of presence in the virtual environment, the illusion of unmediated learning experience can be delivered. Hence, the concept of "Computer Science Replugged" can benefit from the affordances that Computer Science Unplugged thrives on while facilitating or enabling activities that might be impossible, dangerous, or expensive to carry out in reality. In order to foster research and activities associated with the Computer Science Replugged approach, this paper concludes with research questions for using immersive media in Computer Science Education.

TI Tabletop games designed to promote computational thinking

AB There is a growing perception that computational thinking can be developed in unplugged environments. A recent trend among these unplugged approaches is the use of tabletop games. While there are many commercial tabletop games on the market that are promoted as teaching computer science and/or computational skills, little is known about how these games are supposed to support learning. This study investigates the types of tabletop games that are currently being promoted as teaching computational thinking, who such games are marketed towards, and how game designs could provide opportunities for developing computational thinking. We conducted a content analysis to explore the type of tabletop games currently being created, their audiences, and the kinds of game mechanics and design features being implemented to teach computational thinking concepts. In this study, we created a taxonomy of computational thinking tabletop games that identified three primary categories (e.g. code building, code execution, and puzzle games). Games that fall into our categories share similar learning claims, target audiences, and game mechanics. Our taxonomy offers a starting place for educators who want to explore the use of tabletop games for introducing computational thinking concepts in unplugged settings, suggestions for designers, and areas of investigation for researchers.

AB In the digital age in which we live, one of the primary goals of education is to nurture individuals who are capable of thinking creatively, solving problems, and being innovative and productive. Computational thinking is an analytical process that requires defining problems and at the same time solving these problems by proceeding in creative ways. Based on this possible pattern of relationship between computational thinking and creativity, the aim of this study was to determine how two different versions of the computational thinking approach (plugged and unplugged) affect 6th-grade students' creative problem-solving skills (CPSS). Thus, two different teaching modules were designed on the circulatory system with a focus on plugged and unplugged computational thinking. A quasi-experimental design was used. Experiment group 1 utilized the plugged teaching module, experiment group 2 worked with the unplugged teaching module, and the control group in the Turkish middle school science curriculum's inquiry-based science activities. All three groups participated in 16 h of lessons over a 4-week period. We utilized the Creative Problem Solving Skills Inventory (CPSSI) for data collection. The results demonstrated that both the plugged and unplugged teaching modules were more successful at enhancing the CPSS than the inquiry-based science activities. Furthermore the unplugged teaching module was significantly more successful in developing CPSS compared to inquiry-based science activities. Hence, this empirical study demonstrated that both plugged and unplugged computational thinking approaches can enhance CPSS, but also reveals the greater effectiveness of unplugged approaches in fostering middle school students' CPSS.

AB The integration of programming in K-12 setting is a global phenomenon with different implementations in different countries. In Sweden this is a rapid process where programming should be a part of K-12 mathematic and technology with an implementation during 2018 and 2019. The time frame has been narrowly defined, but there are few directives considering which types of programming that should be used. Three main programming types are textual programming, block programming and unplugged programming, this study has a focus on unplugged programming. The research question to answer was: Which are K-12 teachers attitudes on the role of unplugged programming in education? The research study has been a qualitative cross-sectional study with the aim to collect teachers' attitudes towards unplugged programming halfway through their introductory programming course. Cross-sectional study is an approach to capture snapshots of an ongoing process at a given point in time. Data were collected from discussions and online postings during a workshop in the above-mentioned programming course. Participants postings have been grouped into categories in a content analysis based on the frequency of occurrence and relevance for answering the research question. Findings show that most teachers see a benefit of unplugged programming as a means to learn the fundamental programming concepts in their teaching and learning activities. However, there are different opinions on when this unplugged introduction should occur. Some teachers also pointed out that unplugged programming could be used as an alternative to block programming and textual programming when the digital environment lacks or fails. Conclusions are that unplugged activities are a valuable complement to block programming and textual programming, but teachers have different opinions on the optimum age group for unplugged programming activities. The recommendations for K-12 teachers is to seriously consider the unplugged complement, both for pedagogical reasons and as a never-failing analogue backup.

AB Due to its task-based, gamified, and interactive features, unplugged programming activity has been widely employed in education and teaching as an activity away from electronic screens and other digital devices. There is ongoing debate over how to help K-9 pupils develop their computational thinking through unplugged programming activities. Based on findings from 15 experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted domestically and abroad between 2006 and 2023, this study adopts meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze the influence of unplugged programming activities on K-9 students' computational thinking, focusing on an in-depth analysis of variables such as different students' grade, gender, experimental period, research discipline, and unplugged programming activities categories. The results show that unplugged programming activity has a positive effect on the computational thinking of K-9 students (Hedges' g = .631, 95% CI .463, .799, P < .001), and its promotion effect is affected by the variables such as students' grade, learning time, subjects studied, and unplugged programming activities categories. Based on the conclusions of the meta-analysis, this paper proposes several suggestions. For example, it suggests paying attention to the cultivation of computational thinking among middle school students, and mastering the appropriate timing for unplugged programming activities to avoid the plateau effect. Additionally, it recommends strengthening the integration of unplugged programming activities across different disciplines, as well as promoting the use of storytelling and collaborative unplugged programming activities in the classroom.

AB Coding education has become a compulsory course for cultivating children's computational thinking, and its tools in a gamification context can further enhance children's learning enthusiasm. Through the literature review, the researchers identified gamification, unplugging, and low cost as important design requirements for children's coding education tools. In order to verify the effectiveness of teaching design, this study specially developed a gamified coding education tool, "Coding Adventure," which allows child learners to take on gamified roles in real-life scenarios and use instruction cards to complete tasks. While testing the prototype in the on-site teaching environment, the researchers invited 12 kindergarten and elementary school teachers to observe the testing process. Then, they formed a focus group discussion to obtain their feedback on the education tool using MAXQDA software for qualitative analysis. According to the results, teacher participants generally recognize the design concepts of gamification, unplugging, and low-cost, and believe that role-playing and rewards in gamification, as well as the use of safe and simple materials to match the existing teaching environment of the school, are successful design innovations. In addition, gamified storytelling has also been proven to enhance students' team communication using this prototype. Overall, this study proves the effectiveness of the design concepts of gamification, unplugged and low cost on the perceived usefulness and ease of use of the coding education tool system under the Technology Acceptance Model theory framework. These student-centered design concepts will provide valuable experience for the further development of unplugged coding education tools

AB This study examines the effects of plugged and unplugged programming tools used in algorithm teaching at the K-12 level on student computational thinking skills and to determine whether gender is a factor in this process. The study group was designed with a control group pre-test-post-test; quasi-experimental model, that consisted of 109 students in 6th grade at a secondary school. 3 of 4 branches in the school were randomly selected and the experiment and control groups were determined by random assignment. During the study, experiment group 1 was taught Code.org while experiment group 2 was taught unplugged tools, and the control group was taught Scratch. The study lasted for 6 weeks and had 2 lessons per week. The data collection tool used was the "Computational Thinking Levels Scale" as the pre- and post-tests. Our findings showed that while the group that was taught unplugged activities showed positive development for computational thinking skills, there were no significant improvements observed in the other groups. Also, when comparing computational thinking skills, again, there was no significant difference found among the groups. It was observed that group and gender cofactors did not create significant variation among the groups; and when examined on a group basis, differences were found to favor male students when they were performing unplugged activities.

AB This article reports a method for the assessment of computational thinking for adults. To this end, the entire andragogical construction of a course was developed, founded on Ausubel's theories of meaningful learning and on Knowles' theories of adult learning. The proposal consists of presenting a reference model of computational thinking, a method of assessment, and the classification of subjects. As a result of the application of this method, it is possible to classify participants into code literate and unplugged computational thinker. This method was implemented in a bi-national course, where Brazilian and Uruguayan students share the same space for learning. Through this case study and a qualitative analysis of the results, 25% of the participants achieved the status of code literate and 12.5% of the participants achieved the status of unplugged computational thinker. An important contribution of this method is the combination of instruments for assessment and the resulting classification of individuals, as no similar publications have been found to date.

AB Computational thinking (CT) learning activities are increasingly integrated in early-stage school curricula in several countries. Tools used to teach CT in early school years include unplugged coding-i.e., programming without computing devices-and educational robotics (ER)-i.e., giving instructions to a digitally controlled mechanical robot to perform specific actions in a physical environment. Past studies have shown that training coding skills through ER enhances first graders' executive functions (EFs). Little is known, however, about the effects of ER interventions, alone or combined with un-plugged activities, on preschoolers' CT and EF skills. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we assessed whether improvements in preschoolers' coding skills, following interventions based on combinations of unplugged coding and ER, transfer to plugged (computer-based) coding abilities and to EFs such as planning, response inhibition, and visuo-spatial skills. Forty-seven preschoolers from four class groups, with no prior exposure to coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (unplugged coding and ER, two classes) or control (standard school activities, two classes) instructional groups. Four coding tasks, one standardized planning task (Tower of London test), one standardized response inhibition task (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest), and one visuo-spatial standardized task (Primary Mental Ability subtest) were used to assess children's skills at the pretest (before the intervention) and posttest (after the intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 22 children from the experimental group 3 months from the posttest (follow up). The paper discusses the results of this experimental intervention. The results show significant positive effects of the instructional program on children's computer-based coding skills and cognitive abilities, particularly visuo-spatial skills. Between pretest and posttest, children in the experimental group improved in coding, z = 3.84, p = 0.000, r = 0.87, and in visuo-spatial skills, z = 3.09, p = 0.002, r = 0.69. The waiting list control group showed improvements in coding skills only after the intervention, at the assessment point T3, z = 2.99, p = 0.003, r = 0.71. These findings show that practice with tangible and unplugged coding during the last year of preschool not only significantly improves children's skills to solve computer-based coding problems (near-transfer effect), but it may also have some far-transfer effects on cognitive functions, such as visuo-spatial skills.

AB This poster submission introduces "Tokens in Mind", an Unplugged board game designed to teach K-12 students about the ecological and economic aspects of Non-Fungible Tokens including the basic ideas of Blockchain Technology. Although Blockchain technology has been a major breakthrough of this millennium and is being researched extensively at its core, there have been few serious attempts to transfer the concepts for educational purposes. The same applies to the research on the integration of Non-Fungible Tokens at school level. To work on this literature and potential research gap, we invented the board game "Tokens in Mind". In the board game the players need to buy and trade Non-Fungible Tokens, interact with physical "Ether-Coins" and also have to care about an environmental currency called "Eco-Coin" to fulfill several predefined goals. The board game does not require any technical aids like computers, making it accessible to a wider range of students.

AB In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital competencies, the need for a robust and universal method to assess students' algorithmic thinking (AT) skills has become increasingly pronounced. Algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. This research investigates the efficacy of the Cross Array Task (CAT) as an assessment tool for AT skills within Switzerland's compulsory education system. Originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the CAT evolved into a digital activity that runs on an iPad. The CAT's digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. It has also enhanced scalability, making the CAT suitable for widespread use in educational settings. Furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. This research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in Switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. Additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing AT skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual CAT versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. This investigation delineates the developmental progression of AT skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced AT skill development across diverse age groups. Finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on AT performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in AT across educational settings.

TI Unplugged computational thinking at K-6 education: evidence from a
   multiple-case study in Spain
SO EDUCATION 3-13

DT Article
DE Primary school; computational thinking; skills; concepts; unplugged
AB This paper examines the implementation of unplugged tasks across different school settings developing computational thinking skills and concepts at upper primary school children in Spain without programming and without using electronic devices. The study is based on qualitative case study design. Across the three case studies/schools - Waldorf-Steiner, conventional and innovative - several themes and key tasks were emerged for unplugged computational thinking development. The evidence stems from observation field notes and interview transcripts with 152 participants. We collected 94 lessons in total, and we analyzed the data based on a predefined coding scheme and thematic content analysis. We conclude that the detected unplugged tasks demonstrate a great potential to develop computational thinking skills and concepts, even though the teachers are not fully aware of their development. The study highlights the need for teacher professional development on computational thinking teaching and learning. Also, we stress the need for computational thinking skills, concepts, and tasks integration into curriculum explicitly. Given the paucity of research on unplugged methods and computational thinking development in primary education, this study is promising to uncover some prominent issues for further examination and future research agenda.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is valued as a thinking process that is required to adapt to the development of curriculum in primary education. In the context of modern information technology, English as a language subject emphasizes the necessity for changes in both learning and teaching modes. However, there is a lack of up-to-date synthesis research and a comprehensive overview surrounding CT integrated into English language curriculum learning and teaching in primary education. To address this research gap, this study conducted a systematic literature review on CT in the primary English curriculum, based on papers published from 2011 to 2021. The purpose of this review is to systematically examine and present empirical evidence on how CT can be integrated into the teaching and learning of the primary English language curriculum in educational contexts. The review was conducted based on the PRISMA 2020 statement and presents a synthesis of 32 articles. The CT-TPACK model was adopted as a lens and framework to analyze these articles. The results indicate that the relationship among CT, content knowledge of English language curriculum, pedagogy and learning knowledge, technology and resources is highlighted. Research on the integration of CT into English courses using unplugged activities is still insufficient. The research about how teachers and students use CT to support content knowledge of the English language curriculum in various educational contexts is still in its infancy.

AB Computer Science Unplugged is a collection of free learning activities that teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around. This paper concerns the use of games and relatively simple materials to educate young students about computer science fundamentals. It is devoted to the visualization of abstract concepts of the main principles of the computer science through experiential teaching. The activities introduce students to underlying concepts from the distractions and technical details we usually see with computers. We prepare an introduction of how the data are going through the monitor, computer and converter to the Internet. We assume that we need to secure, efficiently organize, search and sort data. The main purpose of this study is to describe a set of learning activities that were found suitable for non-formal learning environments, result of the project granted by national project KomPrax (Competencies for Practice). The main goal was to motivate students actively create a self-knowledge and prepare the informal activities for teaching computer science. The realization of project showed us experiential teaching is an issue that could change the view on the not very popular parts of computer science. All used learning activities could be implemented within the environment of formal institutions such as secondary schools. The quality of suggested learning activities from the methodical point of view is discussed.

AB The recent spread of coding literacy initiatives, such as Hour of Code, Europe Code Week, or Africa Code Week, have underlined the growing importance and interest for computational thinking, often channeled through the use of innovative teaching tools, which foster creativity, collaboration, and interactivity.
   Learning coding notions is generally tied to the use of computers or other electronic devices, and most recent educational tools are based on online visual programming platforms, which may lead to discrimination because of the digital divide, the lack of sufficient infrastructure, or cultural and linguistic barriers.
   However, many code learning activities can be performed in an "unplugged" scenario, often with as little as a pencil and some paper. In fact, CodyRoby is an example of a do-it-yourself unplugged programming kit, published in the end of 2014. Through the use of color-coded cards, inspired by the building blocks of visual programming tools, and the use of intuitive symbols instead of words, the kit enables various fully inclusive coding experiences.
   In this work we present a smartphone-based augmented reality system that empowers this simple tool and transforms a CodyRoby session into an immersive experience. A printable additional kit of markers allows a smartphone app to detect game components, such as the chessboard on which to play, and to present additional gaming elements on screen or to draw customizable decorative elements to stimulate engagement and creativity, especially in younger players. Several different game modes are presented and discussed. The suitability of the system to intimate, small-scale, or even large-scale coding events is also discussed.

AB Programming education is in fashion: there are many methods, tools, books and apps to teach children programming. This gives rise to the question of how to teach programming. Do we teach the concepts with or without the use of a computer, also called plugged and unplugged respectively? This paper aims to measure what method is more effective to start with: plugged or unplugged first. Specifically, we are interested in examining which method is better in terms of (1) facilitating understanding of programming concepts, (2) motivating and supporting the students' sense of self-efficacy in programming tasks, and (3) motivating the students to explore and use programming constructs in their assignments. To this end we conduct a controlled study with 35 elementary school children, in which half of the children receive four plugged lessons and the other half receives four unplugged lessons. After this, both groups receive four weeks of Scratch lessons. The results show that after eight weeks there was no difference between the two groups in their mastering of programming concepts. However, the group that started with unplugged lessons was more confident of their ability to understand the concepts, i.e. demonstrated better self-efficacy beliefs. Furthermore, the children in the unplugged first group used a wider selection of Scratch blocks.

AB Computational thinking (CT) has become a necessary skill of students in the 21st century. Various learning approaches have been developed to foster CT among school students. However, these approaches predominantly rely on computer devices and internet connection and fail to promote advanced computer concepts necessary for programming Therefore, this study developed an unplugged coding activity using flowblocks, the term is coined to represent modified Blockly based on flowcharts with user-friendly syntaxes, as a visual and programming tool, delivered in the form of game -based learning. The activity included a series of game missions to develop five programming concepts. The unplugged coding activity was implemented based on a pre and post intervention design with 160 secondary students who had no prior experience about programming Statistical analyses showed that students' conceptual understanding of coding and CT increased significantly after participation. In addition, the perceptions of their ability to learn programming, namely self-efficacy, statistically grew in the posttest. It is therefore recommended for school teachers teaching basic programming and CT to consider using this offline, engaging and cost-effective approach as an alternative to computer-based methods of programming

AB Researchers are increasingly calling for more computational thinking (CT) teaching tools and activities designed for young children. Considering young children's need to draw on their bodily experiences to learn abstract concepts, this study applied the embodied cognition perspective to design an unplugged (non-computer-based) toolkit with activities that foster CT. This study aimed to explore young children's experiences in unplugged activities. Specifically, children's perceptions about the activities were investigated, and their embodied interactions during the activities were analyzed to reveal how CT emerges as an embodied phenomenon. Results indicate that children had positive perceptions about the activities. In addition, young children's algorithmic thinking and debugging emerged most frequently. Furthermore, this study found that CT extended to both the unplugged toolkit and children's bodies and emerged in perception-action loops. This research provides insight into the instructional design of young children's CT and helps researchers understand how young children develop CT from an embodied cognition perspective.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is a way of making sense of the natural world and problem solving with computer science concepts and skills. Although CT and science integrations have been called for in the literature, empirical investigations of such integrations are lacking. Prior work in natural selection education indicates students struggle to explain natural selection in different contexts and natural selection misconceptions are common. In this mixed methods study, secondary honors biology students learn natural selection through CT by engaging in the design of unplugged algorithmic explanations. Students learned CT principles and practices and applied them to learn and explain the natural selection process. Algorithmic explanations were used to scaffold transfer of natural selection knowledge across contexts through investigation of three organisms and the creation of generalized natural selection algorithms. Students' pre- and post-unit algorithmic explanations of natural selection were analyzed to answer the following research questions: (a) How do students' conceptions of natural selection change over the course of a CT focused unit? (b) What is the relationship between CT and natural selection in students' algorithmic explanations? (c) What are students' perspectives of learning natural selection with CT? Results indicate students' conceptions of natural selection increased and natural selection misconceptions decreased over the course of the unit. Within their post-unit algorithmic explanations, students used specific CT principles in conjunction with natural selection concepts to explain natural selection, which helped them to learn the details of the natural selection process and correct their natural selection misconceptions. Students indicated the use of CT in unplugged algorithmic explanations in different contexts helped them learn natural selection. This study shows unplugged CT can be used to teach students science content, and it provides an example for further CT and science integrations. Implications for the field are discussed.

AB Computational thinking (CT) has gained wide recognition as an important K-12 educational goal, initially in the context of computer science (CS), and more recently also beyond CS. The development of CT teaching materials and approaches is therefore of prime importance. Here, an online learning platform for CT, named Co-De, is presented. It addresses five major aspects of CT explicitly, in the context of a variety of computational problems. Students using Co-De, work through classes, individually or in teams, doing a mixture of unplugged and online exercises and quizzes, as well as some programming. Teachers can fine-tune the default Co-De learning paths to cater for their specific groups of students and/or specific learning goals. Co-De is implemented on top of the open-source learning platform Moodle. It can be used directly at a central server, or a customised version can be installed and used locally.

AB Computational thinking is a relatively new field for teachers and educational researchers, where new pedagogical approaches emerge to teach various aspects of computational thinking that covers various thinking abilities and techniques for solving problems. Computational thinking concept received great attention from researchers and instructors with an increasing interest related to teaching of computational thinking in K-5 education, as well as the role of computational thinking in kids' gaining of thinking skills and digital competences. Various studies have been conducted related to the implementation of computational thinking activities in schools. However, there is a lack of study that analyzes the trends of these studies. In this respect, this study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis and content analysis to investigate the computational thinking studies in K-5 level to explore the current research trends in the field. The analysis covers a total of 156 studies conducted between years 2009 and 2021. The analysis separately provides results for early childhood and elementary levels. The analysis mainly revealed that mostly used pedagogical approaches are robotics, block-based programming, stem, unplugged and gaming activities. In addition, the analysis explored the findings based on four aspects of computational thinking; decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm design.

AB Computational thinking (CT) denotes the idea of developing a generic solution to a problem by decomposing it, identifying relevant variables and patterns, and deriving an algorithmic solution procedure. As a general problem solving strategy, it has been suggested a fundamental cognitive competence to be acquired in education-comparable to literacy and numeracy. However, integrating CT into general curricula has been challenging. Therefore, the current project aims at developing an extra-curricular training of CT for primary school students. From a literature review we identified seven concepts central to CT: i) sequencing, ii) loops, iii) parallelism, iv) events, v) conditionals, vi) operators, and vii) data/variables. In our targeted educational training program, we will specifically address these concepts (which are shared concepts between CT and programming/computer science education) in 2-step procedures using corresponding game-based unplugged and plugged-in activities. Playful unplugged activities, such as a treasure hunt board game for the concept of using variables as placeholders for information, shall allow students getting a first grip on CT processes by actively engaging them. In the game, a treasure is to be hunted by completing a series of arithmetic operations, in which players have to handle different variables (e.g., dice faces, scores, etc.). Building on this unplugged activity, a related plugged-in scenario is a programmable simulation of rain drops filling a glass. While raindrop and glass volume are constants, the fill level of the glass may be the variable to manipulate. In both kinds of activities we aim at clarifying the association between CT-based solving real-life problems and aspects of different STEM disciplines. The series of unplugged and plugged-in activities are integrated into a gamified approach suitable for primary school children, employing badges for mastering specific CT processes to increase students' engagement and for giving feedback about their learning progress. The instructional design will integrate principles of constructionism, game-based and project-based learning, such that students will construct knowledge through playing and interacting with interdisciplinary educational scenarios. The course will be empirically evaluated with 3rd and 4th graders in primary schools. Thereby, the idea of evidence-based instruction is pursued to ensure efficiency and validity of our training.

AB Algorithmic thinking is a type of thinking that occurs in the context of computational thinking. Given its importance in the current educational context, it seems pertinent to deepen into its conceptual and operational understanding for teaching. The exploration of research shows us that there are almost no studies at university level where algorithmic thinking is connected to mathematical thinking, and more importantly, to characterise it and be able to analyse and evaluate it better. The aim of this research is to characterise algorithmic thinking in a university context of the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics by unplugged tasks, offering a model of analysis through categories that establish connections between mathematical and algorithmic working spaces in three dimensions, semiotic, instrumental and discursive. The results confirm the interaction between these dimensions and their predictive value for better programming performance. The study also adds novel considerations related to the role and interaction of mathematical and computational thinking categories involved in algorithmic thinking.

AB The teaching-learning of programming fundamentals is increasing in secondary schools, however, it is a very difficult task for the teacher because the student has not yet achieved full development of their computational thinking, so they have difficulty in learning programming fundamentals. In this article, we describe the development of computational thinking activities prior to the teaching of programming fundamentals and we analyze the data obtained from a pre- and post-test of computational thinking applied to a control group and an experimental group. Afterwards, we analyze the results obtained from a test of programming fundamentals to both the control group and the experimental group.
   The activity has been evaluated during the academic year 2017-2018 by 80 high school students from K-10 (15 and 16 years old), our results indicate that the development of activities of Computational Thinking previous to the teaching of programming fundamentals has allowed the students to assimilate in a better way the learning in the mentioned subject, that is to say, they extended their mathematical logical reasoning to develop the respective flow charts without any difficulty. That is, they expanded their mathematical logical reasoning to develop the respective flow diagrams without any difficulty.

AB This paper describes the implementation and student learning outcomes of a nationwide professional development program for lower secondary and upper secondary school teachers to integrate computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum. Computational thinking comprises important concepts and skills that all students should develop to take an active role in a global society. However, teaching computational thinking is challenging. There are few teachers with the knowledge and skills to integrate computation into their courses. In this program, the participating teachers implemented a set of lesson plans that included both unplugged activities to scaffold student learning, and 'plugged' activities following a use-modify-create learning progression with the Micro:bit device to practice these skills. The study used a quasi-experimental design to compare students' level of computational thinking between the program participants and a control group. The results suggest a positive effect of the learning activities on student computational thinking knowledge and skills as compared to the control group. This result persists after controlling for school context and student gender. This study provides an explicit approach to implementing these activities in the context of a developing country and assesses their effectiveness in a large-scale study.

AB Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students' CT skills through unplugged and pluggedin programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students' gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.

AB Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students' solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.

AB Research and full paper. Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments.

AB This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The "Coding as Another Language" (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated "unplugged" CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (Mchange = 0.94, p < .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (Mchange = 0.27, p = .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p < .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CALKIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum. This provides evidence that a developmentally appropriate curriculum for teaching young children to code can accelerate their acquisition of CT skills.

ID VIRTUAL-REALITY
AB By following the idea of not using computers at all, Computer Science Unplugged has set the course for many interactive, social, and hands-on activities dealing with concepts and problems of Computer Science Education. Through recent developments in immersive media, technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality could enhance such activities or even enable new ones. When providing immersive educational media that induce a sense of presence in the virtual environment, the illusion of unmediated learning experience can be delivered. Hence, the concept of "Computer Science Replugged" can benefit from the affordances that Computer Science Unplugged thrives on while facilitating or enabling activities that might be impossible, dangerous, or expensive to carry out in reality:This paper presents three concepts from Computer Science Education that have been modeled as 3-D immersive educational virtual environments: components of a computer, asymmetric encryption/decryption, and finite state machines. To get a first impression of the effectiveness of these approaches and in order to determine the importance of the level of immersion for the learning process, a study with 78 participants was conducted in which the software was tested on different devices. All activities were found to be significantly effective with regards to the pre- and post-tests. When analyzing these results on the basis of comparing the least immersive setting (laptop) with the most immersive setting (head-mounted-display), the findings indicate different effects with effect sizes between beta = -.17 and beta = .41. This raises two questions: "Which topics from Computer Science Education can benefit from immersive technology?" and "What are the opportunities and challenges of the didactical design of Computer Science Replugged activities?" that have to be adressed in further research.

AB STEM and computer science (CS) education are some of the most important research topics of the last decade. The idea that CS should be a part of STEM is becoming more and more common. The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.

AB Computer Science (CS) is often taught in K-5 education with and through other forms of knowledge, such as CS with Maths, Science, or Art. How two bodies of knowledge and skills are interleaved in a single learning event can be complex to analyse. The sociological framework Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) includes a set of concepts called 'Autonomy' for exploring how different knowledge practices are brought together and with what effects. To explore the value of Autonomy in CS education, we analysed a lesson plan of an activity that teaches CS (algorithms) through magic, visualising the findings on an autonomy plane. This revealed ways to improve learning such as by creating autonomy tours. Autonomy analysis has use in reflective CS K-5 lesson design as CS is often taught with other subjects to overcome timetabling constraints, build on other subjects, or to raise interest in equitable learning experiences.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Grounded in transformative teacher development through the curriculum-based professional learning (CBPL) approach to teaching-learning, this exploratory study surveyed the computational thinking (CT) views of 25 in-service teachers before and after their CT professional development programme workshops. Multivariate outcome multilevel cross-classification analysis showed that after their workshops, these teachers changed their CT knowledge, CT attitudes, CT beliefs, and CT teaching self-efficacy. Teachers reporting greater CT knowledge than others felt greater overall CT teaching self-efficacy, including for both plugged and unplugged CT activities. Moreover, teachers who reported a school culture of sharing and teamwork or sufficient school resources for CT activities were more likely than other teachers to have greater teaching self-efficacy for plugged CT activities or CT activities overall. These results highlight the importance of school culture, school technology resources, and teachers' reported CT knowledge to their CT teaching self-efficacy.

AB The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.

AB Despite increased interest in integrating programming education into K-12 programs, there is a lack of studies on teaching debugging to younger age groups. Therefore, this study proposes practical design components for designing unplugged debugging tasks that affect young learners' debugging performance, problem-solving, and self-efficacy, intending to lower dependence upon tablet-based programming applications. This study incorporated different types of embodiment and language use for designing the unplugged debugging activities. Results indicated that the surrogate embodiment using an everyday language format during the unplugged debugging sessions benefited elementary students' problem-solving and self-efficacy. The discussion includes practical implications for classroom application in elementary classrooms as well as recommendations for future research.

AB In the past, many investigations focused on the impact of programming skills towards learning computational thinking (CT). However, not all schools or instructor are able to implement or deliver programming curriculum at the K-12 level. For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.

AB The inclusion of computational thinking (CT) in the classroom is something that the present and future society is demanding. However, this domain remains largely unexplored, especially in the first years of Primary Education. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the inclusion of the so-called unplugged activities favours the development of CT in the students of the early years of Primary Education. To this end, a quasi-experimental study has been carried out to explore the eventual benefit of a mixed approach that combines both unplugged and plugged-in activities. In particular, 84 second-grade students took part in the experiment. Three questions were evaluated: the development of their CT skills, their motivation towards the proposed instruction, and the influence of students' gender in the two previous areas. The intervention was designed on a selection of activities extracted from Code.org courses, and was divided into two phases, one in which one group worked with unplugged activities and the other with plugged-in activities, and a second where both groups worked with plugged-in activities. Analysing the three proposed questions through tests performed before, in between and after the instruction, it is concluded that the inclusion of unplugged activities in the instruction seems beneficial taking into account CT, motivation and gender.

AB Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi -dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub -dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasiexperiment for 90 sixth -grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares-structural equation modeling, students' models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls' computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys' computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.

AB As schools and districts across the United States adopt computer science standards and curriculum for K-12 computer science education, they look to integrate the foundational concepts of computational thinking (CT) into existing core subjects of elementary-age students. Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books' target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as "foundational," "on-target," or "advanced." We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level.

AB While programming has been recognized as an engaging way to enhance students' learning, implementing programming in K-12 education remains challenging, particularly when it requires access to digital devices or the internet. Therefore, it's essential to consider more accessible methods for teaching crucial programming skills. Given this situation, we turned to unplugged computational thinking (CT) activities to foster interest and develop skills in programming. By introducing programming concepts through unplugged CT activities, this research significantly contributed to the growth of interest and the development of skills among secondary school students. Two hundred and thirty lower secondary school students volunteered to participate in the intervention using a designed unplugged CT activity framework. The CT activities framework consists of four components: puzzles, the Bebras Computing Challenge, problem-solving, and programming concepts. Four schools participated in three- to four-day interventions for four to five hours daily. Quantitative data collection was performed using pre- and post-surveys before and after the intervention phase. A paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated the p-value < 0.05 suggested a significant improvement in interest and programming skills. An overall findings implied that the unplugged CT activities enhanced students' understanding of CT as well as improved their interest and programming skills.

AB Computational thinking is nowadays being widely adopted and investigated. Educators and researchers are using two main approaches to teach these skills in schools: with computer programming exercises, and with unplugged activities that do not require the use of digital devices or any kind of specific hardware. While the former is the mainstream approach, the latter is especially important for schools that do not have proper technology resources, Internet connections or even electrical power. However, there is a lack of investigations that prove the effectiveness of the unplugged activities in the development of computational thinking skills, particularly for primary schools. This paper, which summarizes a quasi-experiment carried out in two primary schools in Spain, tries to shed some light on this regard. The results show that students in the experimental groups, who took part in the unplugged activities, enhanced their computational thinking skills significantly more than their peers in the control groups who did not participate during the classes, proving that the unplugged approach may be effective for the development of this ability.

AB Tasks from Bebras International Challenge on Informatics and Computational thinking are becoming a widespread educational tool for introducing students to the concepts of computer science not only in a form of a contest, but as well in computer science classrooms, games and unplugged activities. There is an ongoing debate in Bebras community about the need and the role of interactivity in Bebras tasks. Practices in different countries range from pen-and-paper solutions to fully interactive systems with immediate feedback. This work introduces classification of Interactive Bebras tasks based on engagement and interactivity taxonomies aligned with current practices of Bebras task development. Proposed classification is then used to categorize the latest tasks from Lithuanian, French and Italian Bebras Challenges. The results from this work shed more light on the properties, potential benefits and shortcomings of non-programming interactive tasks informing future research on the topic as well as current practices of organizing International Bebras Challenge.

ID DESIGN
AB Computational thinking (CT) describes a type of analytical thinking related to computer science and programming. The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) have developed a definition to promote the inclusion of CT in education in the US. The goal of this systematic review is to describe the educational programs that teach CT in primary education (age range 6-14 years) published in indexed scientific journals, following the PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy was carried out in the following five databases: Dialnet, Psycinfo, Scopus, PyscNET and ERIC. A total of 40 articles met the inclusion criteria. The most used programing environment were Scratch (55%), unplugged activities (15%) and Code.org (10%). The software found worked several of the core PC competencies as defined by CSTA & ISTE. This systematic review collects and synthesizes for the first time the educational programs that have proven to be useful for working on CT in children aged 6 to 14 years and relates them to the CT standards established by CSTA, contributing to the knowledge of the tools available to use in the educational field.

AB Learning basic concepts of programming resulting in a development on computational thinking (CT) can be reached by means of digital programming environments. As a counterpart, the application of unplugged programming activities seems also to have promising potential regarding the impact on CT. The main characteristic of unplugged programming is that it comprises activities without the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Since previous research has shown that the application of sense-reason-act (SRA) programming with different types of output demonstrated a better understanding of underlying complex programming concepts with an impact on CT, our research investigates whether the application of unplugged programming, offered via SmartGames, can also generate such a distinctive impact on developing CT. To capture the effects of the different interventions applied, a mixed-methods study was conducted among primary school students aged ten to twelve. Research data were obtained by means of a pretest-posttest questionnaire survey using the validated Computational Thinking Test (CTt), and by conducting interviews to determine the effects of CT and to ascertain identifiable learning effects. Our research indicates that unplugged programming by applying SmartGames can be a consummate regarding the development of CT, similar to SRA-programming using either robotics with tangible output or robot simulations with on-screen output. The research findings identified support our claim that the application of unplugged SmartGames shows equivalent development on CT sub-characteristics in comparison with plugged-in SRA-programming with tangible or on-screen output. A better understanding of complex programming concepts and positive identified learning effects could only be partly demonstrated.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper examined the effect of the Unplugged Programming Teaching Aids (UPTA) on students' computational thinking and classroom interaction. A set of UPTA was created and used in a primary school in southern China. A total of 48 students aged 6-8 were assigned to two classes, with the same instructor and learning materials, but only the treatment group was provided with the UPTA. Both groups were tested on computational thinking ability, children's concrete operation status, degree of ego-centricity, and in-classroom interaction. Results indicated that the children aged 6-8 years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children's computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry.

AB Working on Computational Thinking in the school environment develops specific skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, automation, among others. In this field, a growing research interest relates most educational proposals to the use of technologies. This paper analyses the development of Computational Thinking through unplugged activities in the field of Music. A total of 200 primary schoolchildren, aged 10-12 years old, from public schools participated in the study. Of these, 150 were allocated to the experimental group and 50 to the control group. Data were collected before and after the intervention. The Computational Thinking Test was used to measure computational thinking. Student's t-test was used to compare possible differences between control and experimental groups. Repeated measures models were used to compare differences between pre-and post-intervention, in addition to considering moderation for different academic abilities, environment and ethno-cultural background. The results indicate that there are no mean differences at pre-test for any of the variables. After the intervention in the experimental group, the data indicate an increase in computational thinking in all students with different academic abilities, especially in the high ability group, and an outstanding development in students with learning difficulties, immigrants, and those from rural areas. The conclusions highlight the possibility of proposing educational strategies to develop computational thinking without using technology, and their effectiveness in groups with different psychosocial characteristics.

ID DESIGN
AB Computational thinking (CT) describes a type of analytical thinking related to computer science and programming. The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) have developed a definition to promote the inclusion of CT in education in the US. The goal of this systematic review is to describe the educational programs that teach CT in primary education (age range 6-14 years) published in indexed scientific journals, following the PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy was carried out in the following five databases: Dialnet, Psycinfo, Scopus, PyscNET and ERIC. A total of 40 articles met the inclusion criteria. The most used programing environment were Scratch (55%), unplugged activities (15%) and Code.org (10%). The software found worked several of the core PC competencies as defined by CSTA & ISTE. This systematic review collects and synthesizes for the first time the educational programs that have proven to be useful for working on CT in children aged 6 to 14 years and relates them to the CT standards established by CSTA, contributing to the knowledge of the tools available to use in the educational field.

AB In this poster, we report our experiences with implementing two virtual computer science camps for middle school children. The camps use a two-part curriculum: One designed for 6th grade students using computer science concepts from familiar unplugged games, and the other targeted at 7th grade students using a domain-specific teaching language designed for programming board games.
   We use the camps to pilot the curricular material and provide teachers with practical training to deliver the curriculum virtually. Due to the teachers' commitment to finding successful strategies for delivering the curriculum online, the unplugged and programming activities worked surprisingly well in the remote environment. Overall, we found the use of well-known, unplugged games to be effective in preparing students to think algorithmically, and students were able to successfully code small programs for simple games in a new, functional, text-based language.

AB Integrating parallel and distributed computing (PDC) topics in core computing courses is a topic of increasing interest for educators. However, there is a question of how best to introduce PDC to undergraduates. Several educators have proposed the use of "unplugged activities", such as role-playing dramatizations and analogies, to introduce PDC concepts. Yet, unplugged activities for PDC are widely-scattered and often difficult to find, making it challenging for educators to create and incorporate unplugged interventions in their classrooms. The PDCunplugged project seeks to rectify these issues by providing a free repository where educators can find and share unplugged activities related to PDC. The existing curation contains nearly forty unique unplugged activities collected from thirty years of the PDC literature and from all over the Internet, and maps each activity to relevant CS2013 PDC knowledge units and TCPP PDC topic areas. Learn more about the project at pdcunplugged.org.

AB Working on Computational Thinking in the school environment develops specific skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, automation, among others. Thus, a growing research interest relates the majority of educational proposals to the use of technologies. This work analyzes the development of Computational Thinking through unplugged activities within the Music Area. A total of 200 primary schoolchildren, between 10 and 12 years old, from public centers participated in the study. Among them, 150 were assigned to the experimental group and 50 to the control group. The data was collected at pre and post-intervention times. Computational Thinking Test was used to measure Computational Thinking. The t-Student test was used to compare the possible differences between the control and experimental groups. Repeated measures models were used to compare the differences between pre-and post-intervention, in addition, the moderation of the different academic abilities, environment and ethnic-cultural origin was considered. The results indicate that there are no mean differences in the pretest in any variable. After the intervention in the experimental group, the data indicates an increase in Computational Thinking in all schoolchildren with different academic abilities, especially with the group of high abilities, and an outstanding development in schoolchildren with learning difficulties, immigrants, and those from rural areas. The conclusions highlight the possibility of proposing educational strategies to develop Computational Thinking, without using technology, and its effectiveness in groups with different psychosocial characteristics.

AB Background Unplugged programming is proved to be an effective means to foster the learner-centered programming learning. In addition to the final tests, learners' programming knowledge, skills, and capacities are primarily demonstrated throughout the programming process, particularly in the situation when they encounter challenges and problems. However, few studies examine how learners engage in the programming processes and to what extent unplugged programming fosters learning. This research used a quasi-experimental design to investigate two instructional modes in China's secondary education, namely, the instructor-directed lecturing and the learner-centered unplugged programming. Based on an analytical framework, this research used mixed methods to compare learners' knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under these two instructional modes. Results The research results revealed discrepancies between two instructional modes. First, learners in the unplugged programming class achieved significantly higher scores on the programming knowledge assessment, compared to learners in the traditional lecturing class. Second, compared to the traditional lecturing class, learners in the unplugged programming class had higher test scores of the computational thinking skills, particularly on the cooperativity dimension. Next, discrepancies of in-class behaviors showed that learners in the unplugged programming class had frequent behaviors of listening to the instructor's instructions and discussing with peers, while learners in the instructor-directed class had frequent behaviors of listening to instructor, taking notes, and irrelevant activities. Learners' self-reported attitudes in the unplugged programming indicated a higher level of confidence than learners in the traditional lecturing class. Overall, this research revealed that the learner-centered unplugged programming had potential to improve learners' programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes compared to the traditional instructor-directed lecturing of programming. Conclusions As a feasible and easy-to-use instructional activity in computer science education, unplugged programming is encouraged to be integrated in formal education to increase learners' programming interests, motivations, and qualities. This quasi-experimental research compared learners' programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under two instructional modes. The results revealed critical discrepancies between two instructional modes on learners' knowledge gains, in-class behaviors, and changes of attitudes towards programming. Pedagogical and analytical implications were provided for future instructional design and learning analytics of computer programming education.

AB We report on a late-breaking project that centralizes the Maker practice of loom-based weaving as a locus for unplugged computational thinking. While unplugged activities are appealing for making computation accessible, they also come with the risk of developing inert knowledge. To address and mitigate that risk, we introduce a new framework that we are developing called "Expansively-framed Unplugged" (EfU) computing education. We report on some initial testing and refinement of a learning sequence that starts with weaving on a loom and ends with optimizing code in Scratch. The testing was done with a school librarian who is will be implementing a coding program with students at a middle school library using this EfU sequence.

TI Factors That Predict K-12 Teachers' Ability to Apply Computational

AB Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?
   Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers' probability of performing well on a CT application skills test. Participants.
   Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.
   Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers' performance. Implications.
   Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.

AB Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with devel-oping 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activ-ities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting story-telling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children symbolscript were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.

AB This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot (R) group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and posttest scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for preschool students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.

AB This article is an excerpt from the dissertation entitled "Computational thinking in the mathematics learning process in the final years of elementary school", linked to the Master Program in Management and Educational Practices (PROGEPE) at Nove de Julho University, in particular, to the Research and intervention line learning methodology and teaching pratices (LIMAPE). Its objective was to analyze how the development of computational thinking at school contributes to the teaching and learning process of Mathematics, within the scope of Basic Education, specifically, in the final years of Elementary Education. The research was carried out in a state school, located in the city of Sao Paulo / SP / Brazil. 54 students from the eighth year of the final years of elementary school participated in the research. The methodology used was of a qualitative nature, developed through an intervention research. The data collection instruments used were: questionnaires, focus groups and participant observation. As main results, it was evidenced that the pedagogical practices provide the development of computational thinking, articulated to Mathematics, in particular, the development of programming in the school environment, expanding the possibilities for the construction of new knowledge, in a more collaborative, meaningful and contextualized, still offering countless opportunities for the development of technological and logical-mathematical skills, among others, considered essential to students in the current scenario.

AB This paper investigated the effect of block-based programming and unplugged coding teaching activities on fifth graders' computational thinking skills, self-efficacy, and academic performance. The teaching activities were conducted within the scope of the "Problem-Solving and Programming" unit of the Information Technologies and Software (ITS) course. The sample consisted of 82 fifth graders of three public middle schools in the academic year of 2020-2021. Participants were recruited using random sampling. The study adopted an embedded mixed design. The quantitative stage employed a pretest posttest randomized control group design, while the qualitative staged employed a case study. Quantitative data were collected using the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy Scale (CTSES), the International Informatics and Computational Thinking Activity Task Test (IICTATT), and a Computational Thinking Performance Test (CTPT) developed by the researcher. Qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured interview questionnaire. The quantitative data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis H, paired sample t-test, and ANCOVA test on the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The qualitative data were analyzed inductively using MAXQDA. There was no significant difference in CTSES scores between groups. Experimental 2 had higher IICTATT and CTPT scores than Experimental-1 and control groups. The qualitative findings were grouped into seven categories.

AB Computational thinking is recognized as a critical competency in contemporary education, preparing individuals to tackle complex challenges in a digitally pervasive world. In this quasi-experimental design study with pretest and post-test measures, the possibility of developing computational thinking from the field of didactics of mathematics in higher education students was investigated. This was performed via a problem-based learning (PBL) methodology using problem solving in the experimental group or, alternatively, focused on the analysis of solved problems in the control group. After the intervention, the control group experienced a statistically significant improvement in the scores obtained in the post-test measure. Thus, PBL and problem solving did not lead to an improvement in the students' computational thinking, whereas the analysis of solved problems approach did. Therefore, the results suggested the potential benefits of this latter methodology for teaching computational thinking.

AB Offline methods for reinforcement learning have a potential to help bridge the gap between reinforcement learning research and real-world applications. They make it possible to learn policies from offline datasets, thus overcoming concerns associated with online data collection in the real-world, including cost, safety, or ethical concerns. In this paper, we propose a benchmark called RL Unplugged to evaluate and compare offline RL methods. RL Unplugged includes data from a diverse range of domains including games (e.g., Atari benchmark) and simulated motor control problems (e.g., DM Control Suite). The datasets include domains that are partially or fully observable, use continuous or discrete actions, and have stochastic vs. deterministic dynamics. We propose detailed evaluation protocols for each domain in RL Unplugged and provide an extensive analysis of supervised learning and offline RL methods using these protocols. We will release data for all our tasks and open-source all algorithms presented in this paper. We hope that our suite of benchmarks will increase the reproducibility of experiments and make it possible to study challenging tasks with a limited computational budget, thus making RL research both more systematic and more accessible across the community. Moving forward, we view RL Unplugged as a living benchmark suite that will evolve and grow with datasets contributed by the research community and ourselves. Our project page is available on github.

AB The integration of programming in K-12 education (kindergarten to grade 12) can be viewed worldwide. Expected outcomes of the integration is that students will develop skills in problem solving, creativity, logical thinking, reasoning, and computational thinking. Previous research has identified several challenges for the integration of programming, such as lack of guidance, motivation, time and competence. The aim of this study is to examine the use of programming tools in teaching and learning material by K-12 teachers. The teaching and learning material analysed in this study were collected from a website (Lektion.se) where K-12 teachers can share their teaching and learning material with each other. A document review process, inspired by a systematic literature review process, was used to select the teaching and learning material to be included in the study. The selected teaching and learning material were later analysed through content analysis with deductive and inductive coding. In the study, four types of programming tools can be found in the analysed teaching and learning material: textual programming tools, block programming tools, tangible programming tools, and unplugged programming. The findings of the study indicate potential relationships between the use of different programming tools and school subjects and student grades. These findings can be drawn upon by teachers and other stakeholders in the decision on what programming tools to integrate in classroom practice and how they are to be used.

AB In Japan, we have a growing field called 'Information Education,' but people are paying too much attention to computers and the internet That's why I am proposing unplugging the computer and thinking about the more essential aspects of learning and information design, 'Unplugged' means that technology and multimedia need not he limited to digital forms. Pencil-and-paper and traditional 'by hand' media also have important roles to play.
   In the Multimedia Unplugged workshop, participants use different forms of expression and media, including paper and styrofoam cubes, freeform construction kits and a wide variety of everyday objects, like bamboo leaves and post-it papers. Through this workshop, participants can understand that each medium has its own constraints and opportunities, and have a change to rethink the roles of multimedia from new perspectives. They can then replug and thus he able to choose appropriate media-digital or physical or both-to express their ideas.

AB Computational thinking is taking an ever increasing role in education. According to the Netherlands institute for curriculum development there currently is little to no education on this topic in Dutch primary schools. Since teachers are the key to high quality education, it is important to know which knowledge primary school teachers should have on this topic. This exploratory research is part of a larger design-based study on how 5-6 year old students can develop CT skills at a basic level and what teachers in primary education need to know about computational thinking to teach it. This poster describes the educational design research consisting of a total of three rounds and the results after the first two rounds.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is a term widely used to describe algorithmic thinking and logic reasoning concepts and processes often related to computer programming. As such, CT as a cognitive ability builds on concepts and processes that derive from computer programming, but are applicable to wider real-life problems and STEM domains. CT has recently been argued to be a fundamental skill for 21st century education and an early academic success indicator that should be introduced and trained already in primary school education. Accordingly, we developed three life-size board games - Crabs & Turtles: A Series of Computational Adventures - that aim at providing an unplugged, gamified and low-threshold introduction to CT by presenting basic coding concepts and computational thinking processes to 8 to 9-year-old primary school children. For the design and development of these educational board games we followed a rapid prototyping approach. In the current study, we report results of an empirical evaluation of game experience of our educational board games with students of the target age group. In particular, we conducted quantitative analyses of player experience of primary school student participants. Results indicate overall positive game experience for all three board games. Future studies are planned to further evaluate learning outcomes in educational interventions with children.

AB Introduction. National and international educational bodies emphasize the importance of developing teaching-learning strategies in classrooms that standardize the use of Information and Communication Technologies in a globalized world. For this reason, programming and robotics have been introduced in classrooms in Spain from early childhood education to higher education as a means of contributing to computational thinking and other approaches such as the STEAM construct in which the arts and sciences converge. Objective. This paper aims to present a program of musical activities for early childhood education with which to contribute to unplugged computational thinking and the language of programming and its relevance in 3-year-old classrooms. Method. This qualitative study presents a didactic proposal with musical activities to develop computational language. These activities were conducted during the 2021-2022 school year in two 3-year-old classrooms in a school in the Community of Madrid, Spain. The participants were 38 students and the two tutors of these classrooms. These two professionals collected information on the categories analyzed and the children's evaluation items through participant observation and subsequent recordings. Results. The results show a positive development in literacy in programming and robotics, as well as an improvement in spatial reasoning skills, progress in logical thinking, lower limbs motor control, and oculo-manual dexterity. Conclusions. There exists the need to perform programming and robotics activities in contexts and learning situations in pre-school classrooms for the development of computational thinking and interdisciplinary work in all areas of this stage.

AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities' influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi- experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students' mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students' CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem- posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students' mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students' interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.

AB The changing economic environment in Taiwan has led to an increase in the structure of double-income families. To compensate for the lack of time to take care of their children and the regret of their learning process, parents will send their children to kindergarten early. Parents choose to expose their children to better education and learning models because they do not want their children to get behind at the starting point. The newly introduced unplugged programming language curriculum can develop children's logical and computational thinking skills to face future learning and employment skills in information and communications technology-related industries. The purpose of this study is to examine the parental acceptance of unplugged programming language courses and to analyze the relationship between the variables in the study framework to understand influencing factors. The theoretical basis of the study is the planned behavior theory. This study replaces behavioral intention with parents' acceptance and establishes a basic framework of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The study framework is established by combining the factors of expectation and compensation as antecedent variables of attitude. An online e-questionnaire is distributed to parents of children aged 5-6 years old in Taiwan to collect data. The structural equation model is conducted on 489 data points. Results of the study reveal that expectation and compensation have a significant effect on attitude. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control have a significant positive effect on family acceptance of unplugged programming language. Furthermore, the expectation and compensation psychology affect the parental acceptance of unplugged language programs through attitude. Finally, practical applications and future research directions regarding the promotion of unplugged programming language for young children are provided.

AB Learning efficiently from small amounts of data has long been the focus of model-based reinforcement learning, both for the online case when interacting with the environment and the offline case when learning from a fixed dataset. However, to date no single unified algorithm has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in both settings. In this work, we describe the Reanalyse algorithm which uses model-based policy and value improvement operators to compute new improved training targets on existing data points, allowing efficient learning for data budgets varying by several orders of magnitude. We further show that Reanalyse can also be used to learn entirely from demonstrations without any environment interactions, as in the case of offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL). Combining Reanalyse with the MuZero algorithm, we introduce MuZero Unplugged, a single unified algorithm for any data budget, including offline RL. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm does not require any special adaptations for the off-policy or offline RL settings. MuZero Unplugged sets new state-of-the-art results in the RL Unplugged offline RL benchmark as well as in the online RL benchmark of Atari in the standard 200 million frame setting.

AB Unplugged activities as a low-cost solution to foster computational thinking (CT) skills seem to be a trend in recent years. However, current evidence of the effectiveness of unplugged activities in promoting students' CT skills has been inconsistent. To understand the potential of unplugged activities on computational thinking skills, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Our review of 49 studies examined the influence of unplugged activities to improve students' CT skills in K-12 education between 2006 and 2022. The literature review showed that studies on CT skills were mainly (81.64%) conducted in computer science and STEM education, with board and card games being the most common unplugged activities for fostering CT skills in K-12 education. CT diagnostic tools (36.37%) were frequently used as assessment tools. A follow-up meta-analysis of 13 studies with 16 effect sizes showed a generally large overall effect size (Hedges's g = 1.028, 95% CI [0.641, 1.415], p < 0.001) for the use of unplugged activities in promoting students' CT skills. The analysis of several moderator variables (i.e., grade level, class size, intervention duration, and learning tools) and their possible effects on CT skills indicated that unplugged activities are a promising instructional strategy for enhancing students' CT skills. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of unplugged pedagogy for promoting CT skills in K-12 education. Recommendations for policies, practice, and research are provided accordingly.

AB This study adopted a meta-analysis to explore the effectiveness of unplugged activities (UA) and programming exercises (PE) teaching approaches on computational thinking (CT) education. Through a two-stage literature collection and selection process, 29 articles were included in the meta-analysis, 31 independent effect sizes (16 of UA and 15 of PE) from these articles were used, and a total of 2,764 participants were involved in these studies. CMA software version 3.3 was used to analyze the collected data. The result of the meta-analysis showed that both the UA and PE teaching approaches are useful in cultivating students' CT. Besides, the effect of the PE teaching approach is better than the UA teaching approach in CT education. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of moderator variables (grade level, interdisciplinary course, and experiments duration) on the relationship between UA or PE and CT education. The results showed that the effects of UA teaching approach in CT education was stronger (a) for primary school students than for secondary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with long duration teaching experiments than with medium and short duration teaching experiments. However, these effects are not significant. The effects of the PE teaching approach in CT education were stronger (a) for secondary school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with short duration teaching experiments than with long and medium duration teaching experiments. These effects are not significant either. Therefore, we suggest that (1) the UA teaching approach should be used more for primary school students, while the PE teaching approach should be used more for secondary students; (2) CT education should be integrated into other subjects through UA and PE teaching approaches, and (3) the UA teaching approach requires more teaching time than the PE teaching approach does in CT education.

AB This article examines how a multidimensional, skill-driven curricular framework plays out in diverse primary school settings toward a holistic K-6 curriculum framework. Particularly, it explored how unplugged tasks involve imaginative pedagogies, computational thinking skills, new media literacy skills, and social-emotional skills across three different primary schools by fulfilling two learning conditions, without coding/programming and without using digital devices. Within-case and cross-case analyses were conducted by following the qualitative multiple-case study research design. The evidence stems from lesson analysis, observation field notes, and interview transcripts with 152 participants. We collected 94 lessons from the three schools and we analyzed the data by using a predefined coding scheme grounded upon four frameworks. We conclude that the detected teaching practices uncover promising trajectories by demonstrating a great potential to consider the proposed framework as an effective and age-appropriate pedagogical approach applicable to low-technology and coding-free learning environments. The study highlights the need of teacher professional development, especially on computational thinking in reference to cognitive/intellectual, emotional/affective, social, creative/imaginative, and material dimensions for conscious computational thinking practice implementation. Given the paucity of research on unplugged and, especially, non-programming/coding methods at primary education level, this study can open up prominent issues for further examination and validation.

AB Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on "Learning by Teaching," where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre-posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.

ID ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE
AB Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process composed of computer science ideas and skills that can be applied to solve problems and better understand the world around us. With the increase in technology and computing, STEM disciplines are becoming interwoven with computing. In order to better prepare students for STEM careers, computational literacy needs to be developed in K-12 education. We advocate the introduction of computational literacy through the incorporation of CT in core science courses, such as biology. Additionally, at least some of this integration should be unplugged, or without computers, so that all schools can participate in developing computational literacy. These lessons integrate unplugged CT and science content to help students develop CT competencies and learn natural selection content simultaneously through a series of lessons in which unplugged CT is leveraged for natural selection learning within varying contexts. In these lessons, students engage in the creation of handwritten algorithmic explanations of natural selection. Students build CT skills while making sense of the process, resulting in converged learning about CT and science. This article presents a description of CT, the specifics of the classroom implementation and lessons, student work and outcomes, and conclusions drawn from this work.

AB The AI4GA project is developing a nine-week elective course called Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence and piloting it in several Georgia middle schools. Since we aspire to educate all students about AI, the course addresses a wide range of student abilities, levels of academic preparedness, and prior computing experience, and leaves room for teachers to adapt the material to their own students' needs and interests. The course content is primarily focused on unplugged activities and online demonstration programs. We also provide small programming projects using AI tools as an option for teachers to incorporate. In this poster we describe lessons learned from initial pilot offerings by five teachers who taught 12 sections of the course totaling 299 students. We present evidence that middle school students can successfully engage with substantive technical content about Artificial Intelligence.

AB Programming is an important way to cultivate students' computational thinking (CT) skills, which is the essential ability of students in the 21st century. As one of the mainstream forms of programming education activities, unplugged programming activities are mainly implemented in the early stage of basic education. However, considering the lack of programming experience among Chinese junior high schoolers and the uneven distribution of programming education resources, an 8-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of unplugged activities in improving junior high schoolers' CT skills, and to identify the influence of multiple factors. A total of 93 7th-graders volunteered to participate in the experiment: 62 students were divided into two experimental groups, which were intervened by unplugged activities to repeat the results' reliability, and 31 students were used as the control group without any unplugged programming activities. The results of the intra-group and inter-group comparison show that unplugged programming is a more effective way to improve 7th-graders' CT skills. Students' mathematic performance and previous programming experience had a significant impact on their CT skills, but this impact is not reflected in the process of unplugged programming activities. It can be said that all students can develop their CT skills through unplugged programming activities, regardless of their learning background. In the current context, unplugged programming activities can be used as an effective way for junior high schoolers to improve and develop their CT skills. In addition, this paper also discusses the enlightenment to improve students' CT skills.

AB This article discusses the opportunities and challenges of applying Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) unplugged in Brazil's post-pandemic context from a Public Policy that considers the national reality. In this context, an intelligent platform is being adopted to support learning recovery, focusing on developing writing skills at elementary school. To meet this objective, AI algorithms were developed with computer vision for transcribing hand-written texts and natural language processing techniques for correcting texts in Portuguese and giving feedback to students to improve their writing skills.

ID DISCOVERY
AB The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.

AB With the recent paradigm shift in the teaching of computing and computational thinking skills, schools are engaging pupils as young as five in learning principles and concepts of programming. However, there are still many challenges within primary computing education, including the cost and availability of resources, and teachers' familiarity and/or confidence with these resources. In this paper, we offer an approach that develops a creative story-based pedagogy to address constraints such as these and facilitate the development of lesson plans supporting scaffolding and differentiation. Children's literature is used to introduce concepts such as pattern matching, abstraction and algorithms, along with the three main programming constructs of sequencing, repetition and selection. Through four stages of Read-Act-Model-Program (RAMP), we present a set of unplugged and Scratch-based activities and reflect on the potential impact of this educational opportunity to inspire an early interest in computing.

DE Ozobots; Programming Education; Primary School Programming
AB Algorithmic thinking is a central concept in the context of computational thinking, and it is commonly taught by computer programming. A recent trend is to introduce basic programming concepts already very early on at primary school level. There are, however, several challenges in teaching programming at this level: Schools and teachers are often neither equipped nor trained appropriately, and the best way to move from initial "unplugged" activities to creating programs on a computer is still a matter of open debate. In this paper, we describe our experience of a project aiming at supporting local primary schools in introducing children to programming concepts using Ozobot robots. These robots have two distinct advantages: First, they can be programmed with and without computers, thus helping the transition from unplugged programming to programming with a computer. Second, they are small and easy to transport, even when used together with tablet computers. Although we learned in our outreach events that the use of Ozobots is not without challenges, our overall experience is positive and can hopefully support others in setting up first encounters with programming at primary schools.

AB This article contributes empirically to an ongoing discussion in the cross-section between computer science and the learning sciences. It takes on the question of how pupils can approach basic concepts of computer science and computational thinking skills through problem-solving activities in school. By responding to propositions from researchers within the field suggesting that broader perspectives on integrating computational thinking in subjects should be investigated, examples from an empirical study are given. The study examines a design for learning computational thinking using an unplugged approach, highlighting tangible computational objects as mediators for problem-solving. Three groups of 8th-grade pupils were followed and observed as they set out to collaborate on solving the escape puzzle: The Cyber Weapon, by manipulating computational objects and retrieving a code to stop a virus from spreading. The article highlights how pupils move from open trial-and-error approaches to systematic and iterative decomposing strategies. The article further discusses the implications of tangible computational objects framing problem-solving activities. This is done from a subject-didactical approach, highlighting the interrelatedness between problems, people, and tools as well as how designs like The Cyber Weapon reflect an alternative way to teach pupils basic concepts of computational thinking.

AB This paper describes the design, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a computing component for a three-week writing-intensive introductory program at a liberal arts college. Specific curricular recommendations are presented that could have a direct, positive impact if adopted in similar courses. A two-pronged approach involving a faculty-led HTML workshop, along with student-led contextualized coding studios, was employed. Computing Unplugged activities were used, including a novel Page Rank Unplugged networking activity. An analysis of attitude surveys shows the program positively changed students attitudes about enjoyment solving CS problems, but potentially reinforced the misconception that CS is just learning programming languages.

DE Computational Thinking; Unplugged; Teacher Professional Development
AB In Singapore, O-Level Computing for grade 9 and 10 students was first offered as part of formal education in 2017. Due to a lack of computing teachers, the initial batches of O-Level Computing teachers were professionally developed from those who were already teaching other subjects such as math and science via a conversion course conducted by the Ministry of Education, Singapore. Beyond merely teaching about computer programming, the teachers would need to be trained to teach Computational Thinking (CT), as CT has many practical applications in real-world problem-solving. Therefore, it is imperative to understanding more about in-service teachers' perceptions about CT when they were converted into computing teachers from other subjects. In the current paper, we proffer unplugged approach that could be deployed for teachers to develop notions and confidence about Computational Thinking, which could have implications for teacher professional development at a larger scale.

ID PEER INSTRUCTION
AB Computer science has its threshold concepts as any academic discipline that students struggle to understand deeply. In this work, we report on using an active learning method called scientific debate to teach programming threshold concepts in large unplugged classes. This method involves students by having them defend their position with arguments and scales up with the number of students by leveraging collective intelligence. We present in detail how we apply scientific debate in a programming class. We also collect and discuss student exchanges during debates and gather feedback after the last debate. Students report they stay more focused and motivated during class with scientific debate compared to traditional transmissive lectures. They also indicate that they understood the goal of this new pedagogical contract. Our experience report could help programming teachers willing to replace/complement transmissive teaching with a methodology involving the students.

AB This study investigated the development of computational thinking (CT) in young children within the specific context of Hong Kong. The researchers utilized an unplugged digital arts activity to explore the CT knowledge exhibited by children and document their developmental trajectories. A sample of 23 children aged 3 to 6 years participated in an animation art workshop conducted in a Hong Kong kindergarten. The video data were recorded and analyzed in terms of content. Drawing on a three-dimensional framework combining powerful ideas for teaching coding, the observations and field notes revealed that children's CT knowledge construction aligned with the CT conceptual framework. Notably, older children demonstrated more advanced competences and more complex cognitive structures in terms of the design process, representation, algorithms, modularity, sequences, connecting, choices of conduct, and utilization of hardware/software. These findings emphasize the importance of designing age-appropriate curricula that foster children's CT skills through the animation art.

AB This paper outlines a pilot study which expands the age range of students exposed to computer science through interesting and engaging activities. Through this engagement, the number of students who understood and recognized the concepts covered increased. We hypothesize that these activities can increase the number of students who pursue post-secondary computer science. We present a unique recursion curriculum that exposes nine students aged 11-14 through hands-on experience over a 7 week period at the University of Victoria, Canada. The curriculum was comprised of progressively challenging "unplugged" activities and included programming applications with the Logo based programming language MicroWorlds EX. Curriculum, classroom experience, preliminary results and next steps are discussed.

ID IMPACT
AB In our increasingly technology-dependent society, the importance of promoting digital literacy (e.g., computational thinking, coding, and programming) has become a critical focus in the field of childhood education. While young children these days are routinely and extensively exposed to digital devices and tools, the efficacy of the methods for fostering digital skills in the early childhood classroom has not always been closely considered. This is particularly true in settings where early childhood educators are not digital experts. Currently, most of the efforts in standard early childhood settings, taught by teachers who are not digital experts, appear to revolve around "unplugged" activities that do not directly involve digital tools or devices, and it is not entirely clear how well these "unplugged" lessons promote the corresponding skills in "plugged" settings, such as coding and programming. This article discusses how, through further research, we may be able to devise an effective method for seamlessly building digital literacy among young children, transcending the "unplugged vs. plugged" barriers effortlessly.

AB This study introduces the Concrete Computational Concepts Programming Environments (3CPEs), an innovative approach designed to help elementary students grasp abstract computational concepts through concrete metaphors using tangible and everyday objects. Traditional programming environments for children focus on concrete programming language syntax and semantics yet often fall short in conveying advanced computational concepts. To address this gap, 3CPEs combine the hands-on appeal of computer-science unplugged activities with the versatility of programming environments, using familiar objects and gamified elements to visualize abstract computational and algorithmic ideas. An example is CT (Computational Thinking) Chef, a 3CPEs implementation to enhance elementary students' understanding of programming concepts. Through design workshops with five elementary programming teachers, we preliminarily identified teaching challenges and evaluated 3CPEs' efficacy as an educational tool. The feedback underscores CT Chef's potential in facilitating the teaching of intricate computational concepts for young learners.

DE tangible programming; augmented reality; learning programming
AB Learning and teaching programming is a challenging process for students and teachers. The selection of the appropriate tools for teaching programming is an important task that depends on different factors such as age appropriateness and motivational features. The first encounter with text-based programming languages can be intimidating for novice programmers, especially for young children. Text-based programming languages are artificial languages with a strict syntax that is often not similar to natural language. Although there are examples of those languages developed for young novices, children are also prone to typos. The idea to replace textual language constructs with visual representations or blocks resulted in the development of the visual programming languages (VPLs). However, VPLs require a certain amount of the interaction with the technology (the use of a computer with mouse or keyboard or touch devices like tablets or smartphones) and reading ability since instructions are often presented in the textual form. Besides the essential use of some tool, learning programming requires other students' abilities (for example problem solving). Although it is suggested acquiring of specific abilities depends on student's age, children can reach some developmental stages earlier than expected if the learning context is appropriate. For the purpose of teaching programming even before it is possible with VPLs, visual blocks are then replaced with physical objects such as cards or cubes. Languages that use physical (tangible) objects are referred to as "tangible programming languages" (TPLs). Some of the activities planned with TPLs are even without any technology or "unplugged". Tools or environments used for teaching programming are often closely coupled with the technology (considering hardware and software). The technology is rapidly advancing, but teachers should try to keep the pace because each subsequent generation of students is getting more exposed to and more familiar with the modern technology. If teachers intend to impress students with the novelty approaches, they should be one step ahead of their students and try to balance between both worlds: unplugged and technology-based. In this paper, we present the prototype developed with the purpose of integrating physical objects and virtual elements of augmented reality (AR). The prototype was developed for touch-based devices (tablets or smartphones) and represents a step further in the process of creating the more engaging experience for students' learning of simple programming concepts.

AB Whether a centralized, distributed, or decentralized system approach is selected for Internet-based services affects sovereignty and responsibilities of users and providers alike. Therefore, computer science education can contribute to informed decision-making and citizenship education by teaching power structures of and responsibilities in digital infrastructures. In this practical report, we focus on the example of instant messaging. We analyze three different algorithms for instant messaging that vary in their degree of (de-) centralization. Based on the analysis, we propose a teaching activity called Klemmchat using the concept of computer science unplugged to educate students on the discovered key aspects and trade-offs. We report on results obtained by teaching Klemmchat in two classes in grades 11 and 12. The evaluation shows that the activity is suitable for conveying trade-offs and helping students to engage with the topic. The results, however, leave open whether the acquired understanding affects usage decisions.

ID SELF-EFFICACY
AB There is growing recognition in the education community that the problem-solving practices that comprise computational thinking (CT) are a fundamental component of both life and work in the twenty-first century. Historically, opportunities to learn CT have been confined to computer science (CS) and elective courses that lack racial, ethnic, and gender diversity. To combat this inequity, a number of scholars have proposed integrating CT practices into core curriculum--especially science, technology, engineering, and math curriculum. Successfully achieving the goal of integrated CT, however, depends on frameworks to guide integration, professional development for teachers, exemplars of successful integrations, and identifications of the barriers teachers encounter. Research pertaining to each of these areas is in its infancy. This study addresses these needs through a collective case study of 10 secondary science teachers' implementations of a novel, process-based, unplugged approach to CT/science integration and the factors that supported or hindered their CT/science integration efforts. The results of this work reveal that: (1) an unplugged and process-based approach to CT/science integration shows promise as a vehicle for infusing CT into diverse science classrooms; (2) educators' teaching context exerts a strong influence on their CT-integration efforts and persistence; and (3) special attention is needed to support teachers in their CT/science integrations including algorithm creation. This study also demonstrates the utility of the Fraillon et al.'s CT framework as a guide for CT/science integration efforts and sheds light on the unique affordances of unplugged strategies for implementing CT-integrated science curricula.

AB Studies maintain that computational thinking (CT) is associated with science content and scientific processes as well as with many disciplines. It is thought that designing teaching processes in which science and CT processes take place together makes science learning more meaningful. With this in mind, in this study, the researchers integrated unplugged CT practices into the subject of digestive system to provide an example, and analyzed the effect of this integration on learning through students' model-based explanations by comparing it with the traditional teaching. The findings reveal that in the teaching processes that were designed based on CT practices, the total scores of the students' model-based explanations were significantly higher compared to the traditional approach. When the researchers analyzed the model-based explanations under different sub-features, it was found that this difference was mostly related to sequence and explanatory process sub-features. This reinforces the idea that CT is effective on learning complex and difficult content. Students can reflect their relational and conditional thinking, and thinking in levels practices they perform via CT activities to their scientific models and science content explanations. We believe that these findings will contribute to the scholarship on CT and science integration, which is a trending topic in the literature, and will offer insights to researchers.

AB Due to the pervasive presence of parallel and distributed computing (PDC) in most of the application domains, the need for PDC skills in computing professionals is necessary. This has inspired much interest in including PDC topics in existing computer science (CS) undergraduate curriculum, as evidenced in the ACM/IEEE joint curriculum recommendations. We address this gap by developing new active learning style PDC activities. The application and evaluation of the unplugged activities are described in this paper. The activities highlight key benefits of parallel computing, and the appropriate application of important PDC concepts. An assessment of student engagement has been utilized to measure the effectiveness of our active learning PDC modules. We determine whether the engagement differs by gender, age, and class standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). Results indicated there were slight differences with respect to age and class standing. This research contributes to helping other practitioners in the CS community by providing PDC lesson modules to be integrated into their existing courses. The developed activities and the related lesson plans are intended to provide easier learning of the fundamental PDC concepts in an early undergraduate CS curriculum.

AB Many countries around the world have introduced programming curriculum at K-9 level. For a number of years, a lot of studies have surfaced demonstrating enactments of programming education, for instance through the use of visual programming languages as Scratch in different contexts. However, these studies have had a dominating focus on students of age 7 and older and there are few studies reporting on implementation of programming activities for younger children at preschool. This gap is addressed by this study that focus exclusively on learning of programming in a preschool class of six year olds. We have followed one teacher during six months conducting both classroom observations and interviews. In this paper we report on the didactical methods the teacher used when teaching programming through unplugged (analogue) and digital means, with BlueBot robots, and through Scratch Jr. We end the paper by a discussion reflecting on challenges and lessons learned in relation to introducing programming for young children.

AB Background: Today, computational thinking (CT), which is considered to be a form of literacy, has taken its place in the ICT curriculum of many countries at the K-12 level. Therefore, there is a need for more evidence with regards to a theoretical and practical understanding of CT skills' development of K-12 students.
   Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of an unplugged coding course on primary school students' development of CT skills, differences in their CT skills in terms of socio-demographics such as gender, computer ownership, daily computer use, and home Internet access, and the relationship between their CT and 21st century skills.
   Methods: The research was based a quasi-experimental design with one-group pretest-posttest with follow-up. The CT skills of 212 third and fourth grade students at a public primary school of Turkey were measured with a CT Skills Test before, after, and about ten weeks following having attended an unplugged coding course.
   Results and Conclusions: The results of the study showed that the unplugged coding course statistically significantly improved the participants' CT skills, specifically in algorithmic design, abstraction, evaluation, decomposition, and generalization. Moreover, the findings indicated that primary school students' CT skills were not associated with their socio-demographics. In addition, the students' CT skills were found to be positively and statistically significantly correlated with their collaboration and communication skills.
   Implications: This study contributes to understanding of the effects of unplugged activities on the development of primary school students' CT skills, which is beneficial to teaching practices for CT skills in the primary education.

AB Teaching the principles of how digital technologies work at the K5 level is underexplored. We created six model lessons for children covering this topic as part of the newly updated Czech national computing curriculum. Here, we introduce these lessons. They can be viewed through the lenses of a constructivist educational framework, Evocation - Realization of Meaning - Reflection. Four lessons target younger learners (Grades similar to 2-4) and include topics such as storing and deleting data, data size and computer viruses, among others. Two lessons target older children (Grade similar to 4-5) and focus on the structure and functioning of the internet and digital footprints. The lessons are organized around probing child preconceptions about the lesson topics, showing brief animated videos, and introducing new concepts through instructional analogies, discussions and unplugged activities. The paper describes how the lessons were created and evaluated; discusses their structure along with sample activities and analogies; and presents lessons learnt and how our approach can be used by others. Altogether, the paper contributes by complementing existing reports on primary computing education.

ID EARLY-CHILDHOOD SETTINGS
AB Computational thinking (CT) activities are increasingly being integrated into early childhood schools. We focus on studying children's learning using an "unplugged" (non-computational) learning unit that considers a teacher's knowledge and classroom space and affords seamless adaptation into the classroom given the objects used in the unit and activities that are reminiscent of classic class activities and games. The gap in research that we address is the focus on unplugged activities, which are less common. A learning unit with card games was developed, focusing on two fundamental sorting algorithms: Linear Sort and Category Sort. Sixteen kindergarten children participated in the study. Their CT skills were assessed using a pretest-intervention-posttest single group research design. An increase in CT skills was observed from an intermediate to a sophisticated level; the number of attempts to completion decreased and the average number of attributes the children could sort with increased. Two children's interactions with the activities were analyzed in depth and compared. It was found that two concepts related to algorithms had to be learned separately and sequentially: multiple repeating actions and a stopping rule for repeating actions. With advanced challenges that involved multiple attributes and more than one sorting algorithm, children needed significant support.

AB The participation of girls and women is fundamental in solving problems that the society demands. Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males.

AB The purpose of this study is to systematically examine the existing literature on the teaching approaches and tools used to prepare primary school teachers to integrate computational thinking (CT) in their offering. In addition, the study considers perceptions of teachers towards teaching approaches for CT. Thirty (30) journal articles and conference proceedings that met the selection criteria were reviewed and thematically analysed. Teaching approaches and tools that have been used to train teachers on teaching CT in primary schools include unplugged computing, robotics, programming and game-based learning activities. Teachers' perceptions toward the teaching approaches for integration of CT were positive and progressive after interventions. To support teachers, most studies introduced modules within teacher-education curriculum or a professional development course for in-service teachers. The results indicated that most of the integrations are done within mathematics and science classes. Also, coding remains a useful way to teach CT. To prepare teachers to teach CT concepts and skills, both pre-service and in-service teachers need to practice teaching those concepts in authentic contexts. The review highlights the need for research that addresses the developing country context and working context of teachers as teaching strategies would differ from the developed countries context which has dominated the current research done.

AB Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) implementation in underserved regions faces challenges due to limited digital infrastructure, such as restricted device and internet access. A solution to these challenges lies in AIED Unplugged, a framework designed to address these challenges by tailoring AI solutions to the specific issues prevalent in such regions. AIED Unplugged incorporates principles like Conformity, Disconnect, Proxy, Multi-User, and Unskillfulness, ensuring accessibility by aligning with existing infrastructure, operating offline, simplifying interfaces, and accommodating users' digital skills. Particularly, the framework leverages computer vision to digitalize students' activities and enable AIED-based learning on disconnected, low-cost devices, wherein object detection is crucial to identify which solution areas to digitalize. However, prior research has not assessed the technical feasibility of such applications in the context of AIED unplugged for math education. Therefore, this paper addresses the intersection of "conformity" and "disconnected" principles with an empirical analysis of handwritten equation detection on disconnected, low-cost mobile devices. By optimizing state-of-the-art algorithms for offline inference and considering device constraints, we utilize a dataset of student equations, explore YOLOv8 models, and evaluate its predictive performance. The trained model is converted to Tensorflow Lite for mobile deployment, and a testbed application assesses inference times on diverse low-cost devices, contributing valuable empirical insights to the intersection of AIED Unplugged, Computer Vision, and Education in underserved regions.

AB Popular problems of Computer Science Education that are often solved using algorithms include various number sorting tasks. Sorting algorithms have the potential to emphasize powerful programming paradigms and also to start discussions about algorithm complexity. Research has shown that hands-on activities using analogies and fun activities instead of programming tasks can foster learning in this area in many different ways. In times when much teaching and learning takes place online, the implementing of such unplugged activities can become difficult. Visualizations and animations can help to achieve learning outcomes by making these relatively abstract phenomena more concrete. In particular, virtual reality environments can provide new forms for interacting with visualizations and might well foster motivational, emotional, and perceptual factors that have an influence on learning processes. This paper investigates the differences between these subjective variables in a web application and a VR application for learning sorting algorithms. The results produced initial indicators that learners experience higher presence, absorption, flow, psychological immersion and positive emotions in a virtual reality setting compared to a desktop setting.

AB In this paper we describe a comparison between two different approaches to teach some algorithmic and computational thinking to children, mainly in 3rd grade. Children's learning is taken into main consideration and we want to analyze the difficulties students encounter using the different approaches. Before that, an introduction is done, describing the research framework and methodology, offering the background for this research and outlining the larger research project from which the paper is derived. We then describe the tasks used and look at some examples of the difficulties children face, on one side dealing with the problem of abstract thinking while programming, and on the other having troubles relating more practical activity with what the calculator does.

AB As metaphorical representations showed beneficial effects on several parts of computer science, this paper focuses on the question: How can metaphorical representations in VR enhance the understanding of theoretical computer science concepts? A concept for an immersive educational virtual environment for learning the theoretical computer science concept of finite state machines is presented. A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.

AB Information technology (IT) is transforming the world. Therefore, exposing students to computing at an early age is important. And, although computing is being introduced into schools, students from a low socio-economic status background still do not have such an opportunity. Furthermore, existing computing programs may need to be adjusted in accordance to the specific characteristics of these students in order to help them to achieve the learning goals. Aiming at bringing computing education to all middle and high-school students, we performed a systematic literature review, in order to analyze the content, pedagogy, technology, as well as the main findings of instructional units that teach computing in this context. First results show that these students are able to learn computing, including concepts ranging from algorithms and programming languages to artificial intelligence. Difficulties are mainly linked to the lack of infrastructure and the lack of pre-existing knowledge in using IT as well as creating computing artifacts. Solutions include centralized teaching in assistive centers as well as a stronger emphasis on unplugged strategies. However, there seems to be a lack of more research on teaching computing to students from a low socio-economic status background, unlocking their potential as well to foster their participation in an increasing IT market.

AB Computational thinking (CT) education has drawn increasing attention from educators and researchers. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students' CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students' CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges' g = .600, 95% CI [.465, .735], p < .001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students' CT concepts (Hedges' g = .916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p < .001), CT skills (Hedges' g = .494, 95% CI [.389, .600], p < .001), and CT perspectives (Hedges' g = .927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p < .05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students' CT in GBL; it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed.

AB With the influx of deepfake and style transfer technology in today's news and social media, everyone is told that these applications are powered by artificial intelligence and deep learning, but too often the explanation of how it works goes no further. Rather than waiting until second semester of computer science grad school to learn about generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose a classroom activity to introduce GANs to secondary school students.
   Our GANs Unplugged activity steps outside a traditional classroom environment and forms groups of students that physically act as the various components of a GAN. Students in the Real and Generator (i.e. Fake) groups both draw sketches of animals on index cards, but only the Real group has the secret, specific instructions on how to draw their animals. A third Discriminator group tries to determine if each card it receives came from the Real group or the Fake group. The Discriminator group also makes a single feedback mark on the drawing to suggest how that drawing could be more "real" before passing the card back to the group that drew it. As this game progresses, the Discriminators get better at determining real and fake, that is until the Generators adapt and learn to draw more and more realistic "fake" images.
   We describe the details of GANs Unplugged and present our experience running this activity at three different artificial intelligence summer camps for high school students.

AB In recent years, all over the world, students are less interested in science, especially in computer science where the number of students is shrinking. Also, 50% or more students who initially choose computer science soon abandon the study. Hence, it is essential to attract students to learn computer science, in particular computer programming, via non conventional teaching approach. A promising medium is serious game for learning computer programming, given its fun gameplay characteristics. However, several games intended for computer programming are either hard to be extended, lack of dynamicity, or are not challenging which lead to boredom and lack of motivation in learning. On the other hand, computer science unplugged learning for primary-aged children via mathematical based activities using, for instance, cards and boards, is considered to be very compelling and improving conceptualization. Moreover, problem solving skill acquisition in form of puzzle based learning for university students are immediately pertinent to their problem solving skills development due to its attracting and intellectually challenging nature. Given these facts, this paper presents game contents targeted for different prior knowledge in programming which will be used in serious game for learning programming.

DE Computational Thinking Unplugged; Problem-Solving; Primary and Secondary
   Education; Datalogy; Algorithms
AB In the recent years, there has been a push to engage primary and secondary students in computer science to prepare them to live and work in a world influenced by computation. One of the efforts involves getting primary and secondary students to think computationally by introducing computational ideas such as, algorithms and abstraction. Majority of this work around computational thinking has focused on the use of digital technologies, in particular programming environments (Yadav, Stephenson, and Hong 2017). In today's highly digitalized world, we often associate computational problem-solving processes with the use of computers. Yet, solving problems computationally by designing solutions and processing data is not a digital skill, rather a mental skill. Humans have solved problems for eons and before anyone even thought about the types of digital technologies and devices we know today. The purpose of this article is to examine the historical route of computational thinking and how history can inspire and inform initiatives today. We introduce how computational thinking skills are rooted in non-digital (unplugged) human approaches to problem solving, and discuss how mainstream focus changed to digital (plugged) computer approaches, particularly on programming. In addition, we connect past research with current work in computer science education to argue that computational thinking skills and computing principles need to be taught in both unplugged and plugged ways for learners to develop deeper understanding of computational thinking ideas and their relevance in today's society.

AB There are a plethora of online websites and unplugged materials for people who want to learn how to code. From Scratch in the early years to the more recent (relatively) Massive Open Online Courses, there are many sources of educational and training oriented materials to assist individuals who want to develop computer science skills. Organisations such as Code.org and Khan Academy have been established for students to learn computer programming, animations, game creation or the ability to develop web pages in JavaScript, HTML or CSS. Most of these sites do not require the use of external computing devices and often use virtualised environments (hence missing the valuable experience of hands-on interactivity). In addition, many also have a focus on block-based coding which isolates the student from more traditional coding concepts although opening a simplistic interface for school-level students to engage with computer science curricula.
   In order to provide a suitable environment to teach computer science concepts, Edith Cowan University (ECU) set forth to help schools continue their digital journey by building on what is currently available. ECU developed an interactive website, that a BBC micro:bit could be plugged into and coded on, in Python. In addition, the site had to cater for beginner level coders as well as the more able students. Splitting the desktop screen, the user can choose to code in block or text based code, directly download to the micro:bit and troubleshoot errors if necessary.
   This paper examines the outcomes of the project, the specifics of the implementation and evaluates the benefits to end users. The developed platform has been made freely available to support schools across Western Australia as well as being available globally.

AB This research was aimed at summarizing experimental evidence regarding computational thinking and programming conducted in early childhood education in terms of the variables of plugged-in versus unplugged, age, and gender. For this purpose, the WoS, Scopus, and Eric databases were scanned, and studies determined to be within the scope of the systematic scanning criteria were selected for review. In the current study findings, it was shown that age was an important factor in learning computational thinking in early childhood. In addition, it was found that girls and boys performed similarly in programming and computational thinking. Finally, although there was concrete evidence that both plugged-in and unplugged applications improved children's computational thinking skills, it appeared that unplugged applications were one step ahead, considering the power of having concrete experiences.

AB Educational systems worldwide are including computer science (CS) education in compulsory curriculums from a very young age. Many activities have been proposed to teach young children CS which include different approaches such as unplugged, physical computing, or completely virtual programming interfaces. Despite this, more research is needed to understand which pedagogical approaches capitalise on young children's cognitive and affective capacities throughout their development to promote learning outcomes. Grounded cognition (GC) proposes that our perception and thought are highly influenced by our bodily experiences and that dynamic actions such as movement affect our understanding of the world around us. For young children, experiences integrating cognitive and sensory-motor aspects are often used. These activities could be conceptualised as grounded activities, as they incorporate concrete representation and action. However, the extent to which these activities impact children's learning outcomes has, to our knowledge, not been explored thus far. Moreover, the theoretical background informing these activities and how these map onto the grounded cognition background is often an under-reported aspect in the literature. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a systematic literature review. We identified empirical research reporting CS learning activities with a grounded cognition approach and analysed its activities, CS concepts targeted, how their theoretical background informed their pedagogical design and their outcomes. This paper has important implications for computer science education. Firstly, it presents the empirical evidence using this theoretical background with an emphasis on activity design, which will be useful for academics or practitioners looking to incorporate grounded cognition theory into their instruction. Secondly, it identifies significant gaps in the current practices, specifically in the links between theory and practice and thus is a stepping stone for further research in this interdisciplinary area.

AB Modern preschool education is seen as an essential foundation for nurturing children's digital literacy. Early childhood education environments have witnessed increased emphasis on integrating programming activities in combination with digital tablets. However, little is known about how preschool teachers implement programming as part of pedagogical strategies during practice. In Sweden, although there is a mandate to develop children's understanding of the digital world, programming is not formally mentioned in the revised preschool curriculum. This study systematically investigates how Swedish preschool teachers implement programming activities in their teaching practice. Data was collected through a national online survey (n = 199). Findings revealed a range of apps and resources used in combination with tablets, where activity integration takes place as unplugged programming, digital programming, or as a combination of the former. Teachers markedly attributed intended learning goals around programming to tenets of computational thinking and "twenty-first century skills". Moreover, programming was often actively linked to learning in other domains such as science, technology, mathematics, and language, approaches that show traditional Swedish preschool teaching practices being recontextualized in terms of programming. Based on the reported findings that provide insight into the implementation of programming in preschools, a logical future research avenue lies in exploring the documented programming activities from the perspective of the children.

AB This study investigated the effects of the single programming approach (plugged-in and unplugged) and the mixed programming approach (plugged-in-first and unplugged-first) on the computational thinking (CT) skills of first-grade students. However, focusing only on the programming learning approach itself is insufficient. Therefore, the influences of students' gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence factors on CT skills were also examined. 121 students from China were divided into four experimental and one control groups and engaged in the programming activities intervention for 10 weeks. The data consisted mainly of students' CT skill scores before and after the programming activities intervention. The results showed that both single and mixed programming approaches significantly improved students' CT skills, with the mixed programming approaches being more effective. Furthermore, the study found that the implementation of unplugged activities in the first stage attenuated the effects of programming experience. Furthermore, it was found that the unplugged-first programming approach was able to diminish the effect of students' programming experience on the development of CT skills and could be an essential condition to promote the development of equal CT skills. We also clarified the important role of programming interest and programming confidence in students' CT development. More importantly, a chain mediation effect of programming experience and programming interest between programming confidence and CT was also found.

AB There is a need for developmentally appropriate Computational Thinking (CT) assessments that can be implemented in early childhood classrooms. We developed a new instrument called TechCheck for assessing CT skills in young children that does not require prior knowledge of computer programming. TechCheck is based on developmentally appropriate CT concepts and uses a multiple-choice "unplugged" format that allows it to be administered to whole classes or online settings in under 15 min. This design allows assessment of a broad range of abilities and avoids conflating coding with CT skills. We validated the instrument in a cohort of 5-9-year-old students (N = 768) participating in a research study involving a robotics coding curriculum. TechCheck showed good reliability and validity according to measures of classical test theory and item response theory. Discrimination between skill levels was adequate. Difficulty was suitable for first graders and low for second graders. The instrument showed differences in performance related to race/ethnicity. TechCheck scores correlated moderately with a previously validated CT assessment tool (TACTIC-KIBO). Overall, TechCheck has good psychometric properties, is easy to administer and score, and discriminates between children of different CT abilities. Implications, limitations, and directions for future work are discussed.

AB Across the globe, many students have easy and constant access to media, yet they often receive little or no instruction about the impact of their media consumption. This article outlines a "24 hours without media" exercise in accordance with the guidelines set in Module 7, Unit 1 of the UNESCO curriculum. In the fall of 2010, nearly 1,000 students from a dozen universities across five continents took part in "The World Unplugged" study. Researchers at the University of Maryland gathered students' narrative responses to the going without media assignment and analyzed them by using grounded theory and analytic abduction, assisted by IBM's ManyEyes computer analysis software. Results showed that going without media made students dramatically more cognizant of their own media habits -with many self-reporting an "addiction" to media- a finding further supported by a clear majority in every country admitting outright failure of their efforts to go unplugged. Students also reported that having constant access to digital technology is integral to their personal identities; it is essential to the way they construct and manage their work and social lives. "The World Unplugged" exercise enabled experiential learning; students gained increased self-awareness about the role of media in their lives and faculty came to better understand the Internet usage patterns of their students, enhancing their ability to help young people become more media literate.

AB The interest of children in learning to program computers has increased dramatically in recent years with the adaptation of new programming languages such as Scratch or game-based approaches. That being so, it is still unclear how best to teach programming concepts to young children. There is a gap in the literature on how to introduce basic programming concepts to children at the primary school level, while taking factors such as the grade level and approach used into account. This paper explores the best approach for introducing basic programming concepts to school children in the 4th, 5th and 6th grades as well as the effects of the approaches on students' learning gains (per concept). The concepts addressed here are those used in a traditional Introduction to Programming course, such as programs, memory and variables, inputs and outputs, conditionals and loops. The paper presents the resulting improvements achieved by the 4th, 5th and 6th graders in a multigroup pretest-posttest design, with a control group (the use of a blackboard as an unplugged approach) and two experimental groups (the use of a visual execution environment (VEE) with a mouse and the use of the VEE with Makey Makey). We present the results exploring the interaction between the grade and approach factors for the 144 children (9-12 years old) enrolled in primary education. The results provide statistically significant data indicating how the children succeeded in learning basic programming concepts according to their grade, the type of approach used, and the programming concept under study.

AB In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4-16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhi-bition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).

AB BackgroundDespite its obvious relevance to computer science, computational thinking (CT) is transdisciplinary with the potential of impacting one's analytical ability. Although countless efforts have been invested across K-12 education, there is a paucity of research at the postsecondary level about the extent to which CT can contribute to sustainable learning outcomes.ObjectivesThe current study examines how a series of Arduino-based robotics learning activities capture the fuller essence of concepts related to CT.MethodsCollege students (n = 50) completed a series of six robotics learning activities. Think-alouds, student reflections and performance scores were used to assess students' CT through a robotics challenge in virtual and physical learning environments.Results and ConclusionsStudents verbalized CT concepts related to algorithmic thinking much more than abstraction, problem decomposition and testing and debugging. Students exposed to active learning performed better in a virtual robotics challenge compared to their peers in a traditional-oriented classroom. Students' scores on the physical robotics challenge increased as a function of the number of references they made to CT concepts during the think-alouds. It is possible to design pedagogical experiences that tap into various dimensions of CT at incremental levels of complexity through a series of Arduino-based robotics activities. With the integration of an online simulation, students can visualize and transfer their CT skills between a virtual and physical learning environment, thus leading to more sustainable learning outcomes.
   What is already known about this topicComputational thinking (CT) is the conceptual foundation for problem-solving.CT shifted from unplugged to plugged activities.CT concepts can be fostered through educational robotics.A multi-dimensional approach to assessing CT.Applications of CT provide insights into skill transfer.An integrative theoretical approach to study the 'how' and the 'what' of CT.Implications for practiceEducational robotics activities can cater to a fuller range of CT skills.Virtual simulations with constructive feedback are beneficial for students in traditional settings.Mixed learning environments contribute to making links between lectures and labs.

AB We live in a digital age, not least accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is all the more important in our society that students learn and master the key competence of algorithmic thinking to understand the informatics concepts behind every digital phenomena and thus is able to actively shape the future. For this to be successful, concepts must be identified that can convey this key competence to all students in such a way that algorithmic thinking is integrated in the subject of informatics -beyond a pure programming course. Furthermore, based on the Legitimation Code Theory, semantic waves provide a way to develop and review lesson plans. Therefore, we planned a workshop, that follow the phases of a semantic wave addressing algorithmic problems using a block-based programming language. Considering this, we suggest the so-called SWAT concept (Semantic Wave Algorithmic Thinking concept), which is carried out and analyzed in a workshop with stu dents. The workshop was carried out in online format in an 8th grade of a high school during a coronavirus lockdown. The level of algorithmic thinking was measured using a pretest and posttest both in the treatment group and in a control group and with the help of the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factors for testing informative hypotheses statistically and through a reductive, qual itative content analysis of the students' work results (worksheets and created programs) evaluated. The semantic wave concept was measured using several cognitive load ratings of the students during the workshop and also statistically evaluated with the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factors for testing informative hypotheses, as well as a qualitative content analysis of the worksheets. Re sults of this pilot study provide first insights, that the SWATconcept can be used in combination of unplugged and plugged parts.

DE sorting algorithm; computational thinking; game-based learning
   activities; unplugged computing
AB Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.

AB With the increase of computational thinking (CT) tools in education, there are questions as to whether and how CT might support and/or hinder algebraic thinking of young children. Utilizing seeds of algebraic thinking, we add to this scholarly discussion by presenting examples from a CT activity with four-year old children in which we illustrate how young children are engaged in early algebraic thinking. More specifically, we highlight children's pre-instructional engagement with replacement, a precursor to the concept of variable. The included examples add to our limited scholarship regarding young children's (i.e., ages 3 to 5 years) early development of algebraic thinking of replacement through an unplugged activity that can be implemented within multiple learning environments within children's larger STEM ecosystem.

ID MOTIVATION
AB Computational thinking is becoming an essential skill in educational systems. There is, however, still a great deal to learn about it. This research aims to evaluate whether the inclusion of a specific material (Junior School Bebras Cards) favors the development of primary students' computational thinking skills. For this purpose, 37 fourth-grade students participated in a quasi-experimental study to test the effectiveness of this material and its implementation using gamification. Three research questions were evaluated: the development of computational thinking skills, the influence of gamification on learning outcomes, and the influence of gamification on student motivation. The intervention was designed using the Junior School Bebras Cards, an unplugged (no technology) material proposed by UK Bebras. Two groups worked with these materials: an experimental group that received gamified instruction and a control group that received nongamified instruction. The three research questions were assessed through the comparative analyses of tests performed before and after the intervention. The results reveal that using Junior School Bebras Cards is beneficial for developing computational thinking skills; however, gamification using this material did not improve students' learning outcomes or motivation.

AB The impact of technology on workforce development and socioeconomic prosperity has made K-12 computing engineering and STEM in general a national educational priority. However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally underrepresented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre-and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.

AB This study integrated the augmented reality (AR) technology into the "Coding Ocean" board game to provide players with real-time simulation of ship paths and learning scaffolds. Combined with Scratch block-based programming, an interactive learning environment is developed to assist elementary school students in learning coding skills from the unplugged board game to enhance their computational thinking concepts. The AR board game is focused on the programming concepts of sequential, and/or and loop. Through the process of treasure hunting, the basic concepts of computational thinking can be developed, i.e., abstraction, problem decomposition, pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking. In order to investigate the learning effectiveness of the AR board game on computational thinking and programming skills, a number of 51 third graders from an elementary school were recruited as research samples. The experimental group (n = 26) used the AR board game and the control group (n = 25) used the traditional board game for game-based learning. The experimental results indicate: (1) the learning effectiveness of computational thinking for the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group; (2) the learning achievement of the block-based programming skills for the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group; (3) the cognitive load of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. The AR technology can combine the unplugged board games with plugged learning modules to assist students in game-based learning, which is useful for enhancing computational thinking abilities while reducing the cognitive load.

AB Educators and researchers are becoming interested in cultivating computational thinking (CT). However, in the Hong Kong context, CT-related studies regarding young children are rarely found. The present study aimed to use an unplugged digital arts activity to examine the CT concepts that children performed and document their CT developmental trajectories. Constructionism theory highlights the importance of children engaging in hands-on activities and developing independent thinking skills. Meanwhile, social constructivism theory emphasizes the role of teachers as scaffolders, supporting children in their learning processes. A sample of children (N = 27, aged 3-6) was recruited from a nursery school in Hong Kong to participate in an animation art workshop. A total of 540 min of video data was recorded and collected for content analysis. The teaching team (N = 4) for this workshop were invited to write up their reflective journals, capturing their observations of the scaffolding strategies employed and their perspectives on how children at various levels demonstrated their understanding of CT concepts throughout the entire process. Within an analytical framework based on powerful ideas, the findings from the observations and field notes revealed that the children's CT concepts and practices could be linked with the CT conceptual framework. In this study, older children showed a sophisticated competency and a more complicated mind structure in terms of the CT concept. Our findings highlight the importance of designing an age-appropriate curriculum for nurturing the computational thinking of young children through animation art.

AB Computing has become essential in modern-day problem-solving, making computational literacy necessary for practicing scientists and engineers. However, K-12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in K-12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions.

AB Java instruction generally involves the use of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to assist learners in understanding program structure and code syntax. However, the usage of IDEs can make learners' understanding dependent on the computer, which makes it challenging for them to transition to write their solutions by hand for programming assessments and coding interviews. Research suggests that handwriting slows down learners' thinking processes, helping them to better reflect on and engage in problem-solving contexts. We developed Write2Code, a handwriting-recognition application, to scaffold students' learning of code syntax and logic by recognizing Java input from their handwritten text. In this paper, we present the tool's architecture, features, and third-party technologies. We also describe how our design helps learners understand Java through an interface that promotes an unplugged experience with feedback similar to an IDE.

AB Based on the analysis of sonic famous instructional cases in programming education and in-depth interviews with primary school teachers who are engaged in programming education, this paper focuses on the instructional procedure and strategies of primary school programming education for cultivating students' computational thinking. This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in prograimning education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming.

AB Programming and computational thinking (CT) have been progressively incorporated into early childhood education to prepare children for the digital age. However, little is known about the content knowledge (CK) and pedagogical knowledge (PK) possessed by early childhood teachers in this domain. To address this gap, we conducted a case study of an early childhood teacher in China who had experience developing and implementing an unplugged programming and CT curriculum. The triangulation of data sources was established to collect evidence from videotaped observations, interviews, and lesson plans. For the CK, analysis of these findings revealed that the teacher had a more robust understanding of CT concepts (e.g., sequences, conditionals, and loops) compared to CT practices (e.g., decomposition, debugging) and CT perspectives (e.g., perseverance, choices of conduct). In terms of PK, the teacher could apply the general pedagogical knowledge but was relatively weak in using content-specific pedagogical knowledge. As the first endeavor to investigate an early childhood teacher's CK and PK in teaching programming and CT, this study provides significant implications for improving teachers' professional knowledge and teaching effectiveness in this burgeoning area.

AB Background: Computational thinking (CT) has become a crucial skill for individuals in the 21st century, and while more educators are starting to recognize the importance of CT education, there is still a lack of research on how to teach young children CT, particularly outside of traditional school settings.Objectives: To fill the gap in knowledge, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a web-based parent education program on improving children's CT skills. Additionally, we sought to determine if children's age, gender and family socioeconomic status had any impact on the development of CT skills.Methods: We selected 86 adult-child pairs in the K3 age group to participate in a 4-week intervention program using a quasi-experimental approach.Results: After 4 weeks, children in the intervention group had improved their CT skills more than their peers in the control group. This shows that the intervention was successful in enhancing children's CT skills. Age had a moderating effect on CT enhancement, with older children showing a more significant improvement than younger children. However, children's gender and family socioeconomic status did not have any moderating effects.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CT education can be effectively implemented in the home setting through web-mediated parent education. Encouraging the use of unplugged CT activities at home can aid children in acquiring CT skills.

AB Computational thinking, in particular its central component algorithmic thinking, is one of the more important skills in the 21st century. Therefore it should be taught at school. This work proposes a low-threshold course to introduce algorithmic thinking to students in lower secondary education using the concept of finite state machines. The course is action-based and transitions from unplugged to plugged and even into the real world while sticking to the same topic and using the same visualisations throughout the entire course. It revolves around a chocolate vending machine, the Choc-Machine, which teaches the basics of finite state machines and eventually enables the students to design and formulate their own algorithms that then drive a physical hardware machine.

AB This study utilized unplugged computational thinking learning material named Robot City as the instructional material. The board game corresponds to structural programming, including sequential structure, conditional structure, repetitive structure, and the modeling concept of calling a procedure in programming languages. According to the different task assignment methods, the aim of playing the board game is to help instruct the seventh-grade students in computational thinking, and to explore its impact on students' learning achievements of computational thinking and the behavioral patterns of computational participation. The results revealed that the learning achievements of the students who worked together to solve the clear-ended task objectives were significantly higher than those of the students who cooperated within their groups to solve the open-ended competitive tasks. When the target task is not gained in advance, the students had to compete with other groups and vie for their target task, resulting in students' logical thinking constantly changing and being interrupted. From the behavioral pattern analysis, it was found that the students continued to discuss the problems during the game. The pattern of collaborative analysis was iterative itself, indicating that the board game can deepen students' interaction and enhance their higher level thinking. The results also showed that collaborative creation was observed (RO) by others, proving that the game can increase students' desire to learn, and thus improve their learning achievement.

AB University students learning about computer science (CS) can be intimidated and frustrated by programming, and to make matters worse, the general-purpose programming languages chosen for introducing students to programming contain too many features that have the potential to overwhelm and distract students. We hypothesize that by using a delayed-coding approach with a language designed for teaching a smaller set of features focused on the fundamental CS concepts, such as types, values, conditions, control structures, and functions, student retention and success would improve, especially for those with no or little prior programming experience.
   To test this hypothesis, we split a college computer science orientation class into two sections. One section began programming with a general-purpose language, Python, during week 1. The second section used a new, functional domain-specific teaching language themed around programming simple, well-known physical games. A group of researchers designed the new language with the purpose of giving students a more focused approach to learning basic computer science concepts and emphasizing good programming practices early, such as working with user-defined types and decomposition. Based on student survey responses before and after the two sections and their grades through the two subsequent CS courses, we find that students in the delayed-coding section using the new language had lower engagement in their class. In addition, we find no evidence of a higher pass rate for students from this section in their subsequent computer science courses.

AB In the new Norwegian national curricula, programming and interdisciplinary work have been introduced as two central elements. Furthermore, computational thinking is part of the core elements of the mathematics curriculum. In this paper, we present the findings from a small-scale study within the subjects of mathematics and food and health. The aim was to see if these two subjects could be used as an arena for working with parts of computational thinking, in this case algorithmic thinking and collaboration, and expanding the students' understanding of what programming can be. We think there is a gap in the research regarding this topic, and therefore we wanted to look into this. The students who took part in the study carried out two lessons, one in each subject. In mathematics, the focus was on block programming, while food and health can be seen as unplugged programming. Our findings are based on feedback from 36 students and observations from the lessons. The main finding is that most of the students could not see a link between programming and food and health. Only seven students expressed something that indicated that they did see a link. Thus, it seems like most of the students could not see similarities between the algorithmic thinking in block programming and recipes in food and health.

AB Background and ContextComputational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill and a new form of literacy that everyone should develop to participate in civic society. Sequencing and algorithmic thinking are at the core of CT. This study looked into how young children enrolled in a kindergarten in Colombia develop CT skills.ObjectiveThis paper aims to develop a learning progression of sequencing and algorithm design for early childhood. This goal is complemented by identifying the challenges children face to advance into more sophisticated approaches to problem-solving using algorithmic thinking.MethodFourteen five- and six-year-old students participated in this study. These children participated in unplugged learning activities, and solved two sets challenges with the BeeBot. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze how they solved these algorithmic thinking activities and the challenges they faced in this process.FindingsOur results suggest four increasingly sophisticated approaches to solving these activities: step-by-step, simple decomposition, advanced decomposition, and full algorithm design. We also found different challenges students faced when working on these activities. These challenges can relate to critical cognitive skills.ImplicationsThese results will enable educators to support student learning about CT. These results also open new questions about the relationship between cognitive skills and CT activities in early childhood.

AB This paper describes an unplugged computational thinking (CT) resource for primary and secondary schools developed from Bebras tasks. In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels.
   Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.

AB Imagine the following scenario: It is the 18th century and you are a traveling merchant, planning to sell your goods in a number of cities. Travel is costly and time-consuming, so you want to visit all relevant cities on a round trip while having to travel the shortest possible distance overall. This challenge has written history under the name of Traveling Salesperson Problem (henceforth TSP). Nowadays, the TSP is not only a combinatorial problem central to theoretical computer science, but also highly relevant for human endeavours as vastly diverse as holiday planning, economic supply chain management, and even DNA sequencing. With the goals of enabling players to (a) explore this fascinating problem and (b) develop intuitive as well as algorithmic solution strategies, we created the educational board game "On the Trails of the Traveling Merchant", which can be played in two different versions: cooperative or competitive. To empirically evaluate and compare both versions with regard to relevant aspects of gamefulness and enjoyability, we conducted a user experience study with 12 participants. Using a paper-pencil version of the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) including the Social Presence Game Questionnaire (SPGQ) module, we assessed participants' game experience along the seven general dimensions of (i) immersion, (ii) tension, (iii) competence, (iv) flow, (v) negative affect, (vi) positive affect, and (vii) challenge, as well as the three social dimensions of (viii) empathy, (ix) negative feelings, and (x) behavioural involvement. Additionally, we assessed players' perception of the game as a learning and playing experience, and their rating of the game materials. The present article concludes that players report an overall positive game experience for both the cooperative and competitive version of the game. Furthermore, results indicate that players are in the zone of proximal development while familiarizing themselves with the TSP and coming up with strategies for solving the problem.

AB To foster new generations becoming creators of technology, CoolThink@JC ("Computational Thinking Education," n.d.), a four-year project sponsored by Jockey Club Charities Trust in Hong Kong, aims to advocating that "computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone" (Wing, 2006, p.33). The project targets to upper primary school students, and in that parent education is one of the components. Particularly, parent education focuses on parent-child relationship in learning computational thinking Thus, we propose several approaches involving coding hands-on workshop, instructional video learning and unplugged activities to enhance the parent-child mode of learning in a large-scale project involving 32 primary schools in Hong Kong.

AB Computational Thinking Bins are stand alone, individual boxes, each containing an activity for groups of students that teaches a computing concept. We have a devised a system that has allowed us to create an initial set, test the set, continually improve and add to our set. We currently use these bins in outreach events for middle and high school students. As we have shared this resource with K-12 teachers, many have expressed an interest in acquiring their own set. In this paper we will share our experience throughout the process, introduce the bins, and explain how you can create your own set.

AB Students learning computer science frequently struggle with debugging errors in their code. These struggles can have significant downstream effects-negatively influencing how students assess their programming ability and contributing to their decision to drop out of CS courses. However, debugging instruction is often an overlooked topic, and instructors report feeling unaware of effective approaches to teach debugging. Within the literature, research on the topic is sporadic, and though there are rigorous and insightful studies to be found, there is a need to synthesize instructional approaches for debugging. In this article, we review research from 2010 to 2022 on debugging interventions. We summarize the common pedagogical approaches for learning and categorize how these target specific cognitive and non-cognitive debugging skills, such as self-efficacy and emotion regulation. We also present a summary of assessment methods and their outcomes in order to discuss intervention efficacy and directions for further research. Our sample displays a diverse variety of debugging interventions and pedagogical approaches, ranging from games to unplugged activities. An evaluation of article results also presents encouraging findings, revealing several interventions that improved debugging accuracy and learning. Still, we notice gaps in interventions addressing non-cognitive debugging skills and observe limited success in guiding students toward adopting systematic debugging strategies. The review concludes with a discussion of future directions and implications for researchers and instructors in the field.

AB In the early years, it has become essential to support the acquisition of computational thinking, which is seen as a 21st-century skill and new literacy. A valid and reliable measurement tool is needed to develop and evaluate educational practices related to these skills. TechCheck is a validated unplugged assessment of computational thinking skills for young children. (Relkin & Bers in IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) in 2021 (pp. 1696-1702), 2021; Relkin et al. in Journal of Science Education and Technology 29(4):482-498, 2020). This study aims to adapt and characterize a Turkish version of TechCheck-K for children aged 5-6. Validity and reliability of the Turkish version were established through classical test theory and item response theory, as had been done for the original English language version. Based on classical test theory, the confirmatory factor analysis used A tetrachoric weighted matrix to test the instrument's structure. The one-dimensional structure of the instrument was verified. The KR-20 reliability coefficient for the scale consisting of one dimension and 15 items was .87, which is considered an acceptable level of reliability. Rasch and 2PL models were compared with M2 statistics to determine the item and test parameters based on item response theory (IRT). The 2PL model was chosen as the best fit. Mean TechCheck scores differed based on gender, socio-economic status, past exposure to computers, and coding experience. These results indicate that the Turkish version of TechCheck-K has acceptable psychometric properties for measuring computational thinking skills in children between 5 and 6 years of age.

AB Interest in computational thinking (CT) in the scientific community has increased significantly in the last 4 years, as evidenced by the numerous systematic reviews carried out. However, there is a lack of reviews that update the emerging conceptualization of CT and which also examine the roles of the school curriculum and teachers in the face of CT. A systematic literature review (SLR) consists of a collection of research conducted according to previous criteria with the aim of answering research questions with validity and quality. For this reason, the PRISMA-ScR statement was followed. Articles published in scientific journals, from Scopus and WoS, between January 2018 and August 2021 were included, in the English or Spanish language. The initial search resulted in 492 articles, to which the inclusion-exclusion criteria were applied. The final sample of texts for the present systematic review was n = 145. The texts were analyzed from three perspectives: conceptual, documentary and pedagogical. Thus, a renewal of previous literature reviews was carried out, updating the situation with research from recent years and new data, obtained to contribute to the collective intelligence on methodological strategies (80% of the sample was divided into "plugged" and "unplugged"); educational (more than 50% studied CT evaluation); and resources, including a collection of more than 119 educational resources.

AB Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged in recent years as a thematic trend in education in many countries and several initiatives have been developed for its inclusion in school curricula. There are many pedagogical strategies to promote the development of elementary school students' CT skills and knowledge. Unplugged learning tasks, block-based programming projects, and educational robotics are 3 of the most used strategies. This paper aimed to analyze the effect of Scratch-based activities, developed during one scholar year, on the computational thinking skills developed and concepts achieved by 4th-grade students. The study involved 189 students from two school clusters organized into an experimental group and a control group. To assess students' computational knowledge, the Beginners Computational Thinking Test developed by Several Zapata-Caceres et al. (2020) was used. The results indicate statistically significant differences between the groups, in which students in the experimental group (who performed activities with Scratch) scored higher on the test than students in the control group (who did not use Scratch).

ID NEGATIVE AFFECT
AB Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.

AB In this paper we propose a universal curricular framework that is intended to aid K-6 schoolteachers holistically and humanistically developing their students' computational thinking (CT) skills (e.g. algorithmic thinking, abstraction, decomposition, generalization, patterns recognition, evaluation, and logical thinking). This framework, which can be applied to any subject at the elementary school level, is grounded on specific principles that we have gleaned from both learning theories and considerations on child development. New media literacy skills (NML) and social-emotional skills are also targeted, as they are strongly connected with CT skills and display bidirectional linkages that can comprehensively benefit students in various ways (cognitively, imaginatively/creatively, materially, socially, and affectively/emotionally) without the need for digital technologies or coding. The universal nature of our curricular proposal rests on the following factors: it is based on a cross-disciplinary approach that can be applied in ways that mirror real life; CT is seen as a universal skill that should be learned by everyone, not just computer scientists, and is applicable to every aspect of daily life; one-sided intellectualism is avoided; and, lastly, the resulting classroom practices have an impact on and are influenced by children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.

AB As block-based visual programming platform such as Scratch become more accessible and supportive to children's programming learning, the demand on understanding a trajectory of children's computational thinking development through programming from their early ages increases rapidly in recent years. To explore the developmental process of children's computational thinking in twenty-first century, an experimental study was proposed to study the children's acquisition of computational thinking (CT) concepts and skills through compulsory lessons in schools starting in the fourth grade. A computational thinking framework along with six units of programming lessons were developed as a part of the research, aiming to develop primary (or elementary) school students' computational problem-solving skills through a hybrid-based design of programming activities: combining unplugged (i.e., embodied cognitive activities without computing devices) and plugged (i.e., programming activities with computing devices) approach. Five primary schools participated in our main study, and a mixed method research was conducted with 400 fourth grade students (Male = 259; Female = 141) and 18 teachers involved in delivering our designed lessons. The findings in our study show that students achieved learning gains in basic computational thinking skills in solving programming problems under this hybrid-based learning approach. These findings can give insight for educators and researchers interested in incorporating computational thinking in primary education, which sets forth a research direction on the developmental aspects of computational thinking for children in the neo-Piagetian perspective.

AB The South African government has committed to the implementation of coding and robotics teaching in primary schools. This vision faces the challenge that 16,000 schools in the country do not have computer laboratories, and that most teachers are not trained to teach coding. To address this reality, the TANKS mobile app was developed at Nelson Mandela University in South Africa. It introduces introductory coding concepts without the need for a computer. The scope of the project has broadened since its initiation in 2017. Originally learners were introduced to the game, and each received a game pack. Currently coding kits with various additional resources are made available to schools, mostly after teachers are trained. Based on the evolvement of the project, generic guidelines for the introduction of computer programming in schools, are provided as the main contribution. These guidelines identify the tools to be used here, how to make the project financially sustainable, alternative methods to traditional teaching, as well as the role of training for this kind of coding instruction.

AB The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers' CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre -service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statis-tically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers' CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers' CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.

AB Evolution is a key biological concept, and natural selection is an important mechanism of evolution, but studies indicate students reason about natural selection differently based on organismal context. This paper investigates students' explanations of natural selection in varying contexts after a computational thinking (CT)-central unit designed to scaffold natural selection transfer. The research questions address natural selection change, contextual differences in students' explanations, and patterns of cooccurrences in students' natural selection explanations. Students learned about natural selection through scaffolded transfer via Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE), an unplugged instructional approach. The data source is students' explanations of four pre- and post-unit natural selection scenarios about bacteria, mice, lilies, and mosquitos. This mixed methods study included nonparametric statistics to determine differences between contexts in post-unit explanations and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to create and compare networks of co-occurrences in students' explanations. There were significant differences between the four pre-unit scenario explanations, but the post-unit explanations displayed fewer differences. ENA analysis indicated that student responses for each scenario were not significantly different. These trends indicate students' explanations of natural selection based on context varied less after the unit. These results suggest that the unit was successful in scaffolding transfer of natural selection context across contexts.

AB Developing students' computational thinking (CT) to encourage their creative problem-solving skills has increasingly become a focus of K-12 education. However, there is a shortage of capable teachers to implement CT. In this study, we propose a Computational Thinking Teacher Development framework for the design of a teacher development programme. The framework focuses on four content-related dimensions of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model. TCK refers to the use of a block-based programming environment, including its powerful features such as accelerometers, to programme. CK refers to the knowledge of CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. PCK refers to CT pedagogies that do not involve the use of the programming environments, such as unplugged activities and project-based learning. TPACK refers to the integration of technology, pedagogy, and the CK of CT in context for CT development. We further propose a seven-step structure based on these dimensions for learning to teach a unit of curriculum content. The last three steps involve revisiting the TCK for thinking about the possible use of the powerful features for cultivating creativity, revisiting the CK for the consolidation of knowledge, and revisiting the PCK for the improvement of pedagogies for CT. We implemented the programme to 291 in-service teachers, and the evaluation results suggested that the programme was useful in supporting the teachers to teach CT. When asked about the most useful aspect of the programme, the most frequently mentioned answer was the 'seven steps'. This study contributes to the design of similar programmes for the development of CT teachers.

AB This paper presents a learning community building framework and how it is being used to establish a learning community on the mathematical foundations of computer hardware, namely the binary system. The work builds on previous research efforts targeting gamification of mathematics and is seen under new light offered by the Theatre in Mathematics (TIM) Methodology. The result is a combination of a theatrical game and a board game to teach the binary system to children. The two games are closely related: The theatrical game uses the children's bodies to enact the mechanism of the board game by employing simple rules for interacting with each other. Following simple rules the participants embody the operation of a calculator that is able to transform integers into their binary representations and compute the result of the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). A simulator of the theatrical game is also offered so that learners can explore it for themselves and discover how the arithmetic operations are done, even when they are not in the same physical space with their peers. The board game is essentially a binary version of a counting table or abacus. It offers an alternative mechanism for understanding the validity of the rules of the theatrical game and makes these rules more concrete and accessible to the children. This way they can explore on an individual basis the way that the four arithmetic operations are performed. Both games offer new learning opportunities, when compared with previous work related to game-based teaching of the binary system. The games surveyed mainly focus on the binary representation of numbers without engaging students in active exploration of arithmetic operations in the binary system. Another important aspect of this work is its unplugged nature that enables students to engage their body in a playful inquiry of mathematical ideas. The knowledge developed can be transferred to other number systems and in particular to the decimal system, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of number representations and arithmetic.

AB This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pedagogical practice for technical high school students for developing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities through Internet of Things technologies. The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students.

ID COMPUTATIONAL THINKING
AB In recent years, several research projects have introduced elementary school teachers to computational thinking as a first step in familiarizing students with computer science concepts at an early age. A consistent challenge reported in these initiatives is teaching abstraction. This position paper offers preliminary recommendations for abstraction pedagogy in elementary education. These suggestions stem from an analysis of unplugged abstraction examples showcased during a summer institute on computational thinking.
   By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept.
   Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.

AB Several professional development programs have been designed to train in-service teachers on a computational thinking (CT) curriculum, but few researchers have examined how these affect primary school teachers' self-efficacy and knowledge of CT in emerging economies. This study's objective was to create a framework for the professional development of primary school in-service teachers for the teaching of CT (referred to as professional development for primary computational thinking -PD4PCT) to be integrated into teachers' professional development programs. An initial framework was refined after implementing it at a Namibian school with a group of 14 teachers from five different disciplines (social studies, English, natural science, mathematics, and Afrikaans). Literature reviews, pre-and post -intervention questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and self-reporting diaries were used to collect data. The framework was evaluated by experts via an online questionnaire. The findings show that teachers who participated in the professional development program improved their perceived CT knowledge, beliefs, and confidence to teach CT.

AB Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as a fundamental aspect of modern science education, especially within pre-service teacher education. This study examines the current landscape of CT integration in pre-service science teacher education, drawing insights from an analysis of 18 empirical studies conducted since the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards in 2013. The findings reveal the predominantly exploratory nature of research in this area and underscore the prevalence of positive outcomes associated with CT integration. Moreover, the study identifies prominent pedagogical strategies such as problem-based learning and the engineering design process, highlighting their integral roles in CT integration. Additionally, the findings uncover the interconnectedness of modeling and simulation, computational problem-solving, and systems thinking practices within CT-integrated science interventions. This suggests the necessity for a more holistic approach, including the integration of unplugged activities, the generalization component of CT, and diverse science disciplines, encompassing life science and Earth/space science. Ultimately, these findings emphasize the imperative for further investigation to comprehensively explore CT integration within pre-service science teacher education, aligning closely with contemporary educational standards and practices.

AB O This article aims to report on the experience of using the Peer Instruction methodology allied to the Socrative application in student learning in the technical course of Marketing. The research approach was qualitative and counted with the participation of 30 students and a professor of the discipline Marketing Strategies, Marketing course of a technical school of Presidente Prudente - SP. The data were obtained through the reports of the questionnaires applied, using the software Socrative and observation of the interaction between the pairs. It was concluded that the Socrative is an important tool to help in the application of concept tests, making it the most effective active peer instruction methodology in terms of feedback time and active and collaborative learning.

AB We describe a new introductory CS curriculum initiative that uses analogies and active engagement to develop students' conceptual understanding before applying the concepts to programming. We believe that traditional coding approaches to introducing computer science concepts rely on students to build their own conceptual understanding, rather than grounding their understanding of concepts in what they know from everyday experiences. Using constructivism as a foundation for this curriculum initiative, our approach builds a framework for student understanding anchored in the physical world using simple games and stories to stimulate mental engagement through embodied learning.
   For example, we teach the concept of abstraction and representation by presenting the game of Tic-Tac-Toe as an island divided into nine regions, but the middle one you cannot get to by boat, which is the way two teams arrive to the island. After playing the game once and realizing the game is really just Tic-Tac-Toe, the students understand the example is a representation with modified rules and game pieces. Then we talk about how the set of rules for a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe is an algorithm with instructions for how to play the game, and we use playing the game to explain computation as the execution of an algorithm.
   Based on observations using analogies and active engagement in 6th grade classrooms, we provide many examples explaining how this curriculum initiative is an engaging, effective, and flexible approach for introducing CS concepts.

AB In this research we explore the extent to which computational thinking (CT) is evident in 3-6 year-old children's free play. CT is increasingly viewed as an important aspect of a child's school learning. Typically, CT is connected to learning with computers. Yet, much of learning in the early years is play-based, spontaneous, often learner-initiated, and without technology. Teacher engagement with young learners is important in supporting learning, understanding what learners know, and also in potentially advancing a learner's understanding. The relative newness of CT for many teachers suggests that teachers may not recognize CT during play. We used several frameworks to examine CT. Video clips and images of children in the classroom setting were examined by the researchers and teachers to identify instances of CT. Evidence of CT was found in children's free play. Implications for early years' teachers are discussed.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyse and discuss K-12 mathematics and technology teachers' perceptions on integrating programming in their teaching and learning activities, and perceptions on different programming tools. Design/methodology/approach The approach of a case study was used, with data collected from three instances of a professional development programming course for K-12 teachers in mathematics and technology. Findings The findings show that there are perceived challenges and opportunities with learning and integrating programming, and with different programming tools. Many teachers perceive programming as fun, but lack the time to learn and implement it, and view different programming tools as both complementary to each other and with individual opportunities and challenges. Practical implications The practical implication of the research is that it can provide guidance for teachers and other stakeholders that are in the process of integrating programming in K-12 education. Further, the research provides useful information on teachers' experiences on working with different programming tools. Social implications The social implication of the research is that the overall aim of the nation-wide integration process might not succeed if the challenges identified in this study are not addressed, which could have negative effects on the development of students' digital competence. Originality/value The value of the research is that it identifies important challenges and opportunities for the integration of programming. That is, that many teachers perceive the different programming tools available as complimentary to each other, but are hesitating about what is expected of the integration. Findings could also be valuable for future course design of the teacher professional development.

AB One of the most important tasks an introductory computing student must do is to form a mental model of how the computer works. This could be as specific as understanding the read-evaluate-print loop of an interpreter, or as general as believing that the computer works predictably and deterministically. However, some have fuzzy mental models, or worse, sincerely believe that the computer works unpredictably, "by magic" [2]. We seek to demystify computing for these students using analogy, by showing them something that even magic itself isn't really mystical, it is just computation.
   Magic is one of the most colorful examples of "unplugged" (i.e., without-computer, active learning) activities. It adds a unique facet in that it holds a hidden secret that an audience can be challenged to unfold. Once solved, students are often enthusiastic to perform the magic in front of others. In this session, we will share a variety of magic tricks whose answer is grounded in computer science: modulo arithmetic, permutations, algorithms, binary encoding, probability, etc. For each trick, we will have an interactive discussion of its underlying computing fundamentals, and tips for successful showmanship. Audience participation will be critical, for helping us perform the magic, discussing the solution, and contributing other magic tricks.

AB Contribution: This study proffers a practical flexible framework for teachers and researchers embodying diverse computing pedagogies, to impart computing education (CE) to autistic students. The framework is based on the tenets of inclusion and personalised learning manipulating explicit CE pedagogies.
   Background: Research and anecdotal evidence exhort that autistic learners tend to favor coursework and careers in the STEM domain. Specifically, autistic young people excel in the fields of computing and programming. Computing is very logical and precise and seems to suit the strengths that categorize autism. Yet, the needs of autistic students are still not being met in the classroom as the education sector continues to explore inclusive models for teaching and learning.
   Intended Outcomes: The CE pedagogies infrastructure is propitious to augment the learning potential of autistic students.
   Application Design: The CE framework was developed pursuant to a mixed-methods study, encompassing a literature review, ethnographic experiences of this article's authors, a survey of computing and autism specialist teachers, and teacher interviews.
   Findings: This study's findings underscore that teachers are predisposed to what they know, and are not always aware of the emerging pedagogies beneficial to their pupils. Unplugged computing, physical computing, and predict, run, investigate, modify, and make (PRIMM) were adjudged as the most coveted pedagogical tools for autistic pupils. The greatest gaps in teachers' experience and knowledge were concept maps followed by semantic waves. Although autistic pupils seem to respond best to hands-on activities, teachers require a greater understanding of the range of computing pedagogies, as well as inclusive education.

DE Windows hook; anti-copy and plagiarism; multithreading; character

AB The function of current multimedia instruction monitor system is only limited to essential teaching activity. It uses mostly 'screen surveillance' to monitor the student computer, and limit their activity by locking the screen. But it could do nothing for ones who copy files through network neighbor or mobile storage media which could be done within minutes or even seconds. It is also useless when student escape monitor by unplugging network connection line. In this article, an effective solution is given which is based on windows Hook and multithread technique. Using Hook track the keyboard and mouse operation; extract and examine the characters of the focused-on window and mobile storage media using information got from the tracking. Stop the message transmitting for the operation suspected of copying, or clear the clipboard to invalidate the operation of copying. For the user who unplugged the network connection line for escaping monitor, freeze the screen, lock the keyboard immediately. When the network connection restored, defreeze the screen and unlock the keyboard automatically. So, that becomes offline intelligent monitor. This article gives a brief description of the system design and detail of the algorithm, which is used in the practice of instruction. It is proved from both theory and practice that the technical solution is advanced an reliable, it fills up the blank of the anti-copy and plagiarism in multimedia instruction monitoring system.

AB Programming education is strongly emerging in elementary and high school. Diversity and inclusion are important topics, however, insights on suited programming materials for younger learners with visual impairments are lacking. A wide range of programming materials for children exists, diverse in both what is being programmed (output) and how this is done (input), yet often relying on visual features. An understanding of the usability and accessibility aspects of these different materials is important to inform educational practice and to increase understanding of what makes programming materials suited for low vision and blind children. The aim of this study is to explore the usability and accessibility of programming materials currently used in education to low vision and blind children in the Netherlands. A focus group was conducted with six teachers or IT experts, all working with the target group in special education. The thematic analysis of the discussion of 25 materials (including unplugged lessons, robots and robotic kits, block-based and textbased languages) showed the potential of several materials, especially unplugged lessons, and the continuing search for suited materials and workforms specifically for the blind children. Furthermore, prioritizing "fun" and close connections to children's daily life as well as careful explorations of usability at the cognitive level came forward as important factors for future research and development in programming materials for low vision and blind children. These insights can contribute to obtaining an inclusive approach to programming for young learners.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been widely used to enhance math learning, wherein teacher's involvement is prominent to achieve their full potential. Usually, ITSs depend on direct interaction between the students and a computer. Recently, researchers started exploring handwritten input (e.g., from paper sheets) aiming to provide equitable access to ITSs' benefits. However, research on math ITSs ability to handle handwritten input is limited and, to our best knowledge, no study has summarized its state of the art. This article fulfills that gap with a scoping review of handwritten recognition methods, characteristics, and applications of math ITSs compatible with handwritten input. Based on a search of 11 databases, we found eight primary studies that met our criteria. Mainly, we found that all ITSs depend on receiving handwritten input from a touchscreen interface, in contrast to recognizing solutions developed on paper. We also found that most ITSs focus on similar audiences (e.g., English speakers students), subjects (e.g., algebraic questions), and applications (e.g., in-class to understand student perceptions). Thus, towards enabling equitable access to ITSs, we propose ITS Unplugged (i.e., ITSs that i) run on low-cost, resource-restricted devices with little to no internet connection and ii) receive as well as return information in the format target users usually use) and contribute a research agenda concerning challenges of developing such ITSs.

AB Programming in a text-based or visual language is a complex activity that novices find difficult to learn. In this paper, we present an experience report on how novel activities designed for early conceptual exploration can support middle school students' engagement with and learning of foundational programming concepts beginning programmers often struggle with, specifically, variables, expressions (Boolean, arithmetic, relational), loops, and abstraction. We drew on mathematics education research on dynamic representations to design and develop a set of four non-programming, (open access) web-based, interactive activities and micro-worlds and two unplugged activities as part of a suite of activities that can be embedded in a typical introductory programming curriculum to introduce learners to the target concepts before they encounter them in programming. This report describes the activities as well as our experience with their use as part of an introductory computer science course in three diverse, urban, middle school classrooms in the US.

AB We describe a new introductory CS curriculum for middle schools that focuses on teaching CS concepts using the instructions and rules for playing simple, physical games. We deliberately avoid the use of technology and, in particular, programming, and we focus on games, such as tossing a coin to see who goes first and playing Tic-Tac-Toe. We report on middle-school students' understanding of basic CS concepts and their experiences with the curriculum.
   After piloting the curriculum in 6th and 7th grade electives, we found that students liked the curriculum and using games, while some other students reported struggling with the technical content in the algorithm unit and vocabulary across the curriculum. Overall, students gained an understanding of abstraction and representation, and most students could define an algorithm and recognize a condition. However, they could not correctly organize the instructions of an algorithm. Our results suggest that the non-coding, game-based curriculum engaged middle school students in basic CS concepts at the middle school level, but we believe there is room for improvement in delivering technical content and vocabulary related to algorithms.

AB We introduce biology to the artist's design tool, the storyboard. This versatile organizing and visualizing artistic platform is introduced into the biology classroom to aid in an inventive and focused discovery process. Almost all biological concepts are dynamic, and storyboards offer biology, lecture, wet and computational labs, flexibility, inventiveness, and an opportunity for students to slow down the so-called steps of biological processes and moderate their observations. Storyboarding is a thoughtful and reflective discovery device with enormous potential to break with traditional biology classroom experiences and return to the root of the educational process: storytelling. It will encourage teachers to embark on the remodeling of the biological curriculum with specific technical skills that students and teachers should consider developing to make the STEAM experience tailored to the uniqueness of biological systems. Storyboards offer hands-on, illustrative, and interactive conversations about biology concepts. They are an "unplugged" and contemplative experiences, organizing frameworks for personal expression focused on biological wonders.

AB Computational thinking is believed to be beneficial for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning as it is closely related to many other skills required by STEM disciplines. There has been an increasing interest in integrating computational thinking into STEM and many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of this intervention. This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students' STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95% CI of 0.57-1.14]; p < .001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice.

AB As the definition of computational thinking (CT) in education continues to evolve, researchers have investigated the integration of CT in K-12 learning contexts and students' perceptions and development of CT in these integrated learning experiences. Drawing on prior work, this study explored the evolution of two elementary school girls' conceptions and practices of CT in science as they participated in a four-week CT-integrated science unit at a summer camp using the Dash robot and the Blockly app. Three CT concepts: loops, sequences, and conditionals, were integrated into a unit on the reproduction cycle of flowerless plants. Observations, participant drawings, and analysis of Blockly code revealed that the children improved in their CT practices. In addition, the CT-integrated science unit developed for this study successfully engaged both participants, even when one expressed a low interest in science. The study suggested that defining computing vocabulary, using checkpoint activities with immediate and corrective feedback, and scaffolding of coding concepts with unplugged activities were particularly necessary in promoting CT and the integration of CT and science education in an elementary-level informal learning context.

AB The purpose of this poster presentation is to demonstrate how we can bring art into computational thinking and computer programming spaces. Op-Artist Bridget Riley used geometrical shapes and patterns to express motion across the canvas. The example of Bridget Riley's art inspired U.S. middle and high school students to express their own artistic motions in unplugged and computer coded learning activities.
   This interdisciplinary lesson began with introducing Bridget Riley's artwork and how she arranged different triangles to create the illusion of movement [1]. Students then recreated one of her works by drawing triangles on graph paper with pencils, mimicking Riley's black-and-white compositions. After this unplugged activity, students transferred this understanding of drawing different triangles to the computer using JavaScript. Students used the gridlines behind their drawn triangles to map the pixel coordinates on a computer screen. Students used commands such as fill to set the color of the triangles and p5js.com's built-in triangle command to draw the triangles by specifying the (x, y) coordinates of each of the three vertices on the computer screen. Students then customized and expanded their code to express their interests (e.g., by picking different colors or effects) and to make it interactive for the user (e.g., by having the triangles' top vertices move left and right with the cursor of the screen). By the end of the lesson, each student created different works of Bridget Riley inspired art through their written code.

AB Computational thinking encompasses mental processes that facilitate automated solutions to specific problems. Its integration into primary education is grounded in enhancing problem-solving skills and adapting to the digital environment. However, exactly what constitutes effective teacher training and classroom implementation strategies remains ambiguous. These concerns are addressed in this systematic review, highlighting the influence of school practices on shaping educational curricula. This research examines the implementation of computational thinking and teacher training at the primary education level. Initially, 428 studies were identified in Scopus and Web of Science, and these were then narrowed down to 24 empirical studies published between 2006 and 2023 after applying eligibility criteria and quality assessment. The findings indicate that many educators strive to incorporate computational thinking without adequate training. Robot programming prevails as the primary strategy, and there is high demand for training on the subject, but the use of "unplugged" activities is limited. Nevertheless, before computational thinking in primary education is advocated for, further research is warranted, particularly in the early grades. Educational institutions are encouraged to take the lead in designing and evaluating teacher training programs according to a set of guidelines provided. The successful integration of computational thinking into primary education necessitates more robust pedagogical approaches supported by appropriate teacher training.

AB Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, visualizations became common-place in public communications to help people make sense of the world and the reasons behind government-imposed restrictions. Though the adult population were the main target of these messages, children were affected by restrictions through not being able to see friends and virtual schooling. However, through these daily models and visualizations, the pandemic response provided a way for children to understand what data scientists really do and provided new routes for engagement with STEM subjects. In this paper, we describe the development of an interactive and accessible visualization tool to be used in workshops for children to explain computational modeling of diseases, in particular COVID-19. We detail our design decisions based on approaches evidenced to be effective and engaging such as unplugged activities and interactivity. We share reflections and learnings from delivering these workshops to 140 children and assess their effectiveness.

AB Motivated by ever-increasing computational resources at edge devices and increasing privacy concerns, a new machine learning (ML) framework called federated learning (FL) has been proposed. FL enables user devices, such as mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to collaboratively train an ML model by only sending the model parameters instead of raw data. FL is considered the key enabling approach for privacy-preserving, distributed ML systems. However, FL requires frequent exchange of learned model updates between multiple user devices and the cloud/edge server, which introduces a significant communication overhead and hence imposes a major challenge in FL over wireless networks that are limited in communication resources. Moreover, FL consumes a considerable amount of energy in the process of transmitting learned model updates, which imposes another challenge in FL over wireless networks that usually include unplugged devices with limited battery resources. Besides, there are still other privacy issues in practical implementations of FL over wireless networks. In this survey, we discuss each of the mentioned challenges and their respective state-of-the-art proposed solutions in an in-depth manner. By illustrating the tradeoff between each of the solutions, we discuss the underlying effect of the wireless network on the performance of FL. Finally, by highlighting the gaps between research and practical implementations, we identify future research directions for engineering FL over wireless networks.

AB Electric buses (EBs) are considered a more environmentally friendly mode of public transit. In addition to other practical challenges, including high infrastructure costs and short driving ranges, the operations of EBs are more demanding due to the necessary battery charging activities. Consequently, more sophisticated optimisation models and algorithms are required for effective operations. This paper presents an EB scheduling problem with multiple termini and service routes. Various realistic but complicated factors, such as shared facilities at multiple termini, the flexibility of plugging and unplugging chargers before an EB is fully charged, stochastic travel times, and EB breakdowns, are considered. We propose an integrated learning and mixed -integer linear programming (MILP) framework to overcome the computational difficulties when solving the problem. This framework leverages the strengths of reinforcement learning and MILP for fast computations due to its capability of learning from outcomes of state-action pairs and computational effectiveness guaranteed by the constraints governing the solution feasibility. Q -Learning and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are adopted as our training methods. We conduct numerical experiments on artificial instances and realistic instances of a bus network in Hong Kong to assess the performance of our proposed approach. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms the benchmark optimisation approach, in terms of penalty on missed service trips, average headway, and variance of headway. The benefits of our proposed framework are more significant under a highly stochastic environment.

DE Calculation; pedagogical demonstration; experiment; teaching method
AB Students are currently used to technological devices that solve almost all mathematical problems and hence, the difficulties they are having to face the mathematical situations that are presented to them in class and that leads to them not knowing how to defend themselves in real situations. Therefore, the general objective of this research is to develop a didactic strategy to contribute to the development of mental calculation skills in Upper Basic students. The research was quasi-experimental. With a sample of 25 students to whom a pretest and a posttest were applied. In addition, an observation sheet was applied, with a control group made up of three teachers, for which there are 75 data in total. As a result, it was obtained that there were changes between the pre-test and the post-test and it was revealed that the strategy used with unplugged computational thinking develops mental calculation skills, therefore, it was considered that the strategy is relevant and a proposal was designed with this didactic strategy.

AB From the approval of Resolution No. 1 of 2022, Computing formally integrates the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC). The regulations establish that States, Municipalities and the Federal District must establish parameters and pedagogical approaches for the implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12 Education. In this direction, considering the need for continued teacher training in the subject, the present study presents the pedagogical structure of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for K-12 Education teachers. The purpose of the course was to train them on the concepts and applications of the CT, seeking to identify difficulties and barriers in learning. With a quantitative methodology, the course was carried out with 192 teachers. The results showed that both the pedagogical organization and the didactic materials are suitable for training in CT and that the acquisition of contents occurred satisfactorily.

AB The integration of computational thinking (CT) in mathematics education is increasingly important due to its intersections with mathematical thinking and its role in the 21st century. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of innovative tools to enhance mathematics education, including the exploration of gamification techniques to improve student engagement. While previous research suggests that the inclusion of CT activities at an early age can positively impact students' motivation and CT skills, the potential benefits of incorporating gamification techniques into CT instruction remain unexplored. In this study, we investigated the impact of shallow and deep gamification techniques on the CT skills and the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of second-grade students in a blended teaching sequence that combined both unplugged and plugged CT activities. A quasi-experimental design was used with a control group and an experimental group. The findings suggest that both shallow and deep gamification techniques can be effective in improving CT skills in young students, but deep gamification may have a stronger impact on motivation. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on the integration of gamification techniques in CT instruction.

AB Integration of computational thinking (CT) into numerous disciplines across the K-12 curriculum is gaining increased attention. In this study, based on the technology integration framework, we investigated how students' understandings, difficulties, and attitudes towards learning subject matter varied at different levels of CT integration. We implemented six different case studies by integrating CT into six different subjects: science, traffic, language, biology, geography, and physics. Two primary and four secondary school teachers, 38 primary school students, and 113 secondary school students were involved in the study. We categorized these lessons according to the technology integration model: unplugged activities are grouped as augmentation level; robotic and two modeling activities are labeled as modification level; modeling and digital storytelling activities are labeled as redefinition level. Our findings indicate that students reported a very positive attitude toward redefinition level activities. Teachers stated that compared to standard instructional activities, students can go deeper and understand the subject content better in CT integrated lessons.

DE Programming in preschool age; Direct control; Program as record
AB In this paper we present our approach to study whether and how some basic computational pre-constructs (like agent, instruction, sequence, program, record, order) can be developed with preschool children (aged 5 to 6).
   In many kindergartens Bee-Bots are used to introduce programming. But Bee-Bots themselves do not offer any visual representation of a program which we think a little bit limiting. To conduct our research, we wanted to use a tool that would enable direct control of an agent and a visual representation of a program as a record. Being inspired by the former work of our colleagues, educational programming environments for lower primary years and research within the Emil project we have designed an educational microworld for pre-school children Circus.
   In Circus environment children control a main character (an acrobat) in order to train it a performance. Instructions for the acrobat are interpreted immediately and a record of given instructions is being made simultaneously. Circus is aimed to be used with an interactive whiteboard by a small group of children and by a teacher moderating the activities of children with the software. The microworld itself is open, it doesn't present any tasks to be solved.
   In the paper we document an iterative process of designing, developing, using, evaluating and analysing a) Circus microworld, b) activities to be done by children in the microworld and related unplugged activities c) methodology for teachers d) worksheets for children in the cooperation with two kindergartens and present some findings.

AB Over the past decade, the call to foster computational thinking (CT) in every child has received considerable attention. However, there is little understanding of whether children are developmentally ready to think computationally and what specific CT concepts and skills can be developed at various ages. This study explored the developmental and gender differences in CT skills of 197 Grade 4-6 students (aged 9-13) before being exposed to instruction and investigated the age-gender interaction effects on their CT acquisition in an intervention combining both programming and non-programming (unplugged) activities. Results show that students' CT skills followed a developmental progression before instruction. Gender difference across ages was insignificant in conditionals, logical operators, pattern recognition and generalization skills. Additionally, students of different ages developed CT differently during the intervention, and their CT acquisition was unaffected by gender. Implications for practice and research in CT education were discussed.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is a new literacy of 21st century that can be transferred to and applied in different real-world situations, although being derived from the discipline of computer science. Tangible robots or child-friendly digital apps are used to implement coding education with the goal of promoting young children's CT. However, there are still controversies on the validity and applicability of CT in early childhood, mainly due to the vagueness of the learning mechanism underlying young children's CT. This cross-sectional study examined the associations among sequencing ability, self-regulation and CT among Chinses preschoolers (N = 101, M-age = 5.25 years, SD = 0.73). Results showed that sequencing ability and self-regulation have positive and significant associations with CT, and the relationship between sequencing ability and CT was fully mediated by self-regulation, even after controlling for child gender, age, and family socioeconomic status (SES). This implies CT in early childhood as a combination of sequencing ability and self-regulation. Findings of this study have implications for early childhood CT education programs, suggesting the need to assist children in learning sequencing and how to self-regulate in coding (both plugged and unplugged) and STEM activities.

AB Motivated by the success of ensembles for uncertainty estimation in supervised learning, we take a renewed look at how ensembles of Q-functions can be leveraged as the primary source of pessimism for offline reinforcement learning (RL). We begin by identifying a critical flaw in a popular algorithmic choice used by many ensemble-based RL algorithms, namely the use of shared pessimistic target values when computing each ensemble member's Bellman error. Through theoretical analyses and construction of examples in toy MDPs, we demonstrate that shared pessimistic targets can paradoxically lead to value estimates that are effectively optimistic. Given this result, we propose MSG, a practical offline RL algorithm that trains an ensemble of Q-functions with independently computed targets based on completely separate networks, and optimizes a policy with respect to the lower confidence bound of predicted action values. Our experiments on the popular D4RL and RL Unplugged offline RL benchmarks demonstrate that on challenging domains such as antmazes, MSG with deep ensembles surpasses highly well-tuned state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin. Additionally, through ablations on benchmarks domains, we verify the critical significance of using independently trained Q-functions, and study the role of ensemble size. Finally, as using separate networks per ensemble member can become computationally costly with larger neural network architectures, we investigate whether efficient ensemble approximations developed for supervised learning can be similarly effective, and demonstrate that they do not match the performance and robustness of MSG with separate networks, highlighting the need for new efforts into efficient uncertainty estimation directed at RL.

AB Model-eliciting activities (MEAs) challenge students to interpret a problem and collaboratively create solutions using the engineering design process. This Innovation to Practice article describes how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher educators can use MEAs to build elementary teachers' understanding of computational thinking (CT). Our Countdown Timer MEA is aligned with Grade 2 mathematics and computer science standards. We discuss how this MEA created opportunities for teachers in an online graduate STEM education course to engage as learners in unplugged and plugged CT activities. Teachers used algorithmic design and debugging to model a digital display and to create block-based code for a recess countdown timer. Teachers' reflections on how their learning experiences were different than those offered in step-by-step CT lessons allowed teachers to envision how MEAs can promote important CT dispositions of persistence in open-ended problem solving and tolerance for ambiguity. By aligning MEA design and facilitation with the phases of the engineering design process, teacher educators can use modeling to engage elementary teachers in facets of CT that are transferable to the elementary STEM classroom.

AB There has been an increased determination to introduce coding and computational thinking early in education. So, programming has progressively grown and got an essential focus in European education following international trends. This idea of introducing computer programming into the classroom it's not recent; it came in 1960 by the investigations of Seymour Papert. The potentialities of teaching children's programming languages as an incubator of powerful ideas started in that decade, but it extended and continues to be used nowadays in a vast way. The programming was used to engage children in new ways of thinking, but much more critical than that, putting the student in a role to think about the thinking process. So with this context in mind, we aim to present a series of important ideas that rule the way that Computational Thinking could be applied inside of the Pre-School classroom. For that, we identify in this research the strategies and methodologies that allow teachers to implement these activities with children. Stating good practices and tools, pointing out some tips and ideas on designing projects in Pre-School Education that will allow the working of the computational thinking with the students of the XXI century.

AB Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as an important method in the United States for helping children learn to solve complex problems and develop skills necessary for coding and other computer science-related endeavors. Research has revealed that CT can be encouraged with children as young as 3-4 years of age. While some preschools and schools are incorporating CT into their curriculum for young children, ages 0-8 years, it is important to understand how environments outside of schools are using CT with young children, particularly given that, in the United States, a large percent of young children, ages 0-5 years, are not in formal school settings. This study provides insight into this area through 20 interviews with educators in libraries and museums to understand how they incorporate CT into their work with young children, ages 0-8 years, and their families. The interviews reveal that library and museum educators are using a variety of developmentally-appropriate approaches, such as play, experimentation, and narrative, to design and offer a diverse array of engaging, hands-on CT activities that allow young children to practice CT in child-centered, meaningful ways.

AB TechCheck is an assessment of Computational Thinking (CT) for early elementary school children consisting of fifteen developmentally appropriate unplugged challenges that probe six CT domains. The first version of TechCheck showed good psychometric properties as well as ease of administration and scoring in a validation cohort of 768 children between 5 and 9 years of age. To increase sensitivity and reduce possible ceiling and floor effects, grade-specific versions of TechCheck (K, 1, 2) were subsequently created. In the present study, we explored how CT skills could be compared across grades when grade-specific versions of TechCheck are administered. First, we examined TechCheck raw score distributions and responses within CT domains in a representative sample of students from the three grades. Grade-specific Z-scores and percentile rankings were then calculated. To show utility of this normalization system, we used percentiles to compare CT outcomes between first and second graders who participated in a ScratchJr coding educational intervention. While TechCheck change scores suggested an unexpected 42.74% difference in CT outcomes between first and second grade, application of the normative scoring system indicated a more plausible 5.17 percentile rank difference between grades. Normative analysis may provide a more meaningful way to compare results across grades when grade-specific versions of TechCheck are used. Implications for the future use of the TechCheck CT assessments are discussed.

AB Incorporating computational thinking (CT) ideas into core subjects, such as mathematics and science, is one way of bringing early computer science (CS) education into elementary school. Minimal research has explored how teachers can translate their knowledge of CT into practice to create opportunities for their students to engage in CT during their math and science lessons. Such information can support the creation of quality professional development experiences for teachers. We analyzed how eight elementary teachers created opportunities for their students to engage in four CT practices (abstraction, decomposition, debugging, and patterns) during unplugged mathematics and science activities. We identified three strategies used by these teachers to create CT opportunities for their students: framing, prompting, and inviting reflection. Further, we grouped teachers into four profiles of implementation according to how they used these three strategies. We call the four profiles (1) presenting CT as general problem-solving strategies, (2) using CT to structure lessons, (3) highlighting CT through prompting, and (4) using CT to guide teacher planning. We discuss the implications of these results for professional development and student experiences.

AB Computational thinking (CT) is a multidimensional term that encompasses a wide variety of problem-solving skills related to the field of computer science. Unfortunately, standardized, valid, and reliable methods to assess CT skills in preschool children are lacking, compromising the reliability of the results reported in CT interventions. To surpass this limitation, we validated in a sample of 700 preschool students (5-6 years old) the Beginners Computational Thinking test Short-Form (BCTt-SF), an unplugged 12-item instrument that measures three of the most common computational concepts assessed in preschool research: sequences, loops, and conditionals. The theoretical model underpinning the BCTt-SF was supported by dimensionality assessment, which suggested that preschool students can be distinguished in terms of four specific abilities (i.e., sequences, simple loops, nested loops, and conditionals) and that all of these abilities were related by a general factor. We modeled this hierarchical structure with a bi-factor model that presented excellent psychometric properties, from good statistical fit indices to adequate reliability of the general ability. To take full advantage of this model, we created an online application in the Shiny platform (https://computationalthinkingtests.shinyapps.io/SF-BCTt/) for the seamless scoring of examinees by any teacher or researcher who uses the BCTt-SF to assess CT skills in preschool children. Finally, we demonstrated how the BCTt-SF can be used to test the impact of educational interventions for improving CT skills in preschoolers.

AB Coding games, both computer-based and "unplugged" ones, have been increasingly used over the past years to promote code literacy and to bring basic programming concepts to the larger public, in particular to children in pre-school, elementary, and middle school ages.
   Chatbots on instant messaging (IM) platforms provide a modern and friction-free interface that allow software developers to instantly connect with a wide audience, making use of familiar conversational interface patterns.
   "Code Hunting Games" is a chatbot-based multiplayer game, which engages multiple teams in a "treasure hunt" guided by a Telegram bot. On their track to the treasure, teams are challenged with a sequence of coding puzzles that must be solved using the conversational interface. At the same time, teams must move through physical space in order to reach geographical locations marked by a code, as indicated by the bot.
   In this paper we present the implementation of the game and describe several large-scale deployments, including one Europe-wide game session during Code Week 2017 with more than 160 competing teams. The system is freely available online for custom game sessions.
   We discuss the game's impact, in terms of engagement for children in particular, lessons learned during development and deployment, and future work.

AB This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.

AB Background and Context: Since the surge of grounded cognition (GC) theories in cognitive psychology, many studies have focused on demonstrating the importance of embodiment and sensorimotor activities on students' conceptual development. In computing education, however, there is not yet a conceptual framework for developing age-appropriate.
   Objective: This paper brings these sets of work together, showing how the wider grounded cognition literature can be of value to computing education. The main objective of the paper is to suggest and set the theoretical foundations of a model for conceptual development in the early years of computing education.
   Method: The paper is a conceptual paper and thus, it is based on an extensive account of relevant cognitive psychology and education literature.
   Findings: The paper presents a model for conceptual development (EIFFEL-Enacted Instrumented Formal Framework for Early Learning in Computing). The general premise underlying the model is that programming concepts are first realised as actions performed on objects; as such, it aims to describe children's conceptual development in computing from their first actions on concrete objects to entirely abstract forms of action representation epitomised by a program.

AB There is a growing consensus that AI literacy requires a holistic lens, including not only technical knowledge and skills but also social and ethical considerations. Yet, providing holistic AI education for upper-primary students remains challenging due to the abstract and complex nature of AI and a lack of pedagogical experiences in schools. Against this backdrop, this study employs a design-based research (DBR) methodology to develop pedagogical solutions and theoretical knowledge. Drawing upon theories about AI literacy and learning sciences, this study proposes a novel pedagogical approach, namely, the embodied constructionist approach. This approach, by integrating embodied analogies and constructionist making, forges a cyclical understand-make-reflect process. Through this process, students gradually comprehend the conceptual, technical, and ethical dimensions of AI, towards holistic development in AI literacy. This approach was implemented and fine-tuned in authentic classrooms with 107 sixth graders over two years. During the implementation, a variety of qualitative data were collected from classroom observation, video-recording, student interviews and artifacts, and debriefings with the teacher. Using a case studies method, this study uncovered the overall learning progress demonstrated by the class in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical and critical reflections, as well as the reflections and struggles experienced by individual students. This study offers an age-appropriate pedagogy to promote inclusive, holistic AI education in the crucial, yet under-examined upper primary context. It highlights the potential of integrating AI literacy and computational thinking (CT) in K-12 education, while contributing to theoretical knowledge about embodied cognition and constructionism in the context of AI education.

ID GIRLS; ICT
AB The number of women in technical and computing roles in the High Energy Physics (HEP) community hovers at around 15%. At the same time there is a growing body of research to suggest that diversity, in all its forms, brings positive impact on productivity and well-being. These aspects are directly in line with many organisations' values and missions, including CERN. Although proactive efforts to recruit more women in our organisations and institutes may help, the percentage of female applicants in candidate pools is similarly low and limits the potential for change. Factors influencing the career choice of girls have been identified to start as early as primary school and are closely tied to encouragement and exposure. It is the hope of various groups in the HEP community that, by intervening early, there may be a change in demographics over the years to come. During 2019, the Women in Technology Community at CERN developed two workshops for 6-9 year olds, which make the fundamental concepts of ICT and Computer Science accessible to young people with no prior experience and minimal assumed background knowledge. The immediate objectives were to demystify computer science, and to allow the children to meet a diverse set of role models from technical fields through our volunteer tutors. The workshops were run multiple times over 2019. This paper contains an overview of our motivation, describes the content of the workshops, results, lessons learnt and the future evolution of such activities.

AB Computational thinking (CT) can be developed in a multitude of ways. Well-known examples are plugged-in and unplugged applications that focus primarily on the (combined) usage of visual, textual, or tangible modalities. Less obvious are applications where CT development can be established via an auditory modality, to which the importance of creativity is attributed. When reasoning from such a different contextual perspective, it is interesting to investigate whether the self-creation of electronic music influences CT development and what added value can be attributed to creativity. Therefore, a mixed-methods study was conducted on primary school pupils aged 10 to 13 using FL-Studio Mobile (c) music-producing software. Quantitative data were obtained using a pre-test-post-test assessment administered via a validated Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Qualitative data were obtained by conducting interviews to ascertain identifiable effects on CT sub-characteristics to determine the influence of creativity and creative thinking and children's perceptions in this regard. Our results indicate that applying music-making software has measurable effects on CT development, particularly with respect to invoking and using auditory modalities. Notable findings were identified on the CT sub-characteristics "loops", "conditionals", "functions", "nesting", and "CT tasks required". Our study shows that producing music using technology stimulates creativity, which seems to be an important parameter for CT development. Differences between girls and boys were observable. Further research on the interaction between CT and creativity, combining different modalities, is recommended.

AB Background: The pedagogy of computational thinking has gained extensive traction across numerous nations globally, with a particular emphasis on nurturing computational thinking in the formative years of early childhood. Nevertheless, the efficacy of diverse instructional approaches in the domain of programming education, with regards to fostering the advancement of computational thinking abilities in young children, remains a subject of ongoing debate.
   Objectives: The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of programming education in fostering computational thinking skills in young children. The central focus revolves around a meticulous exploration of the influence exerted by diverse modalities of programming education on the cultivation of computational thinking abilities in early learners.
   Methods: A total of 32 empirical studies were incorporated into the analysis. Out of these, 77 effect sizes were deemed to meet the predefined inclusion criteria for the present study. The statistical analysis was executed utilizing Stata version 17.0 software.
   Results and Conclusions: The acquisition of programming skills can enhance the advancement of computational thinking in young children (Hedges's g = 0.49, 95% confidence interval [0.40, 0.58]), thereby yielding a moderate effect. When considering the triad of programming education modalities, it becomes evident that graphical programming surpasses both tangible programming and unplugged programming in terms of its efficacy in fostering the growth of computational thinking in young learners.
   Implications: The foregoing contributes significantly to the systematic cultivation and augmentation of computational thinking skills in young children. It establishes a foundational framework for early childhood educators and instructional tool designers to effectively and purposefully impart programming knowledge to children.

AB Background/Context: Previous research has established the significance of academic study time on undergraduate students' academic performance. The effects of other uses of time are, however, in dispute. Some researchers have argued that students involved in activities that require initiative and effort also perform better in class, while students who engage in mainly passive entertainments perform less well. Other researchers have argued that students who are connected to the campus through residence, work, or extracurricular activities perform better, while those who are separated perform less well.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The purpose of this study is to develop a theory-based framework for examining the academic consequences of student time and to test hypotheses drawn from this framework using survey data.
   Research Design: The framework focuses on three dimensions of student time use: study/non-study, active/passive, and connecting/separating. The survey analysis is based on more than 6000 responses to the 2006 University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES).
   Findings/Results: Controlling for students' socio-demographic backgrounds, previous academic achievements, and social psychological stressors, we find that study time is strongly connected to both academic conscientiousness and higher grade point averages. We find that "activating" uses of time, such as physical exercise and volunteering, are associated with higher levels of academic conscientiousness, but not directly to higher grade point averages. Time spent on "passive" entertainments show negative associations on academic conscientiousness. Uses of time that connect students to campus life showed relatively weak and inconsistent effects, as did uses of time that separate students from campus life. Off-campus work was an exception. It showed a strong net association with lower grade point averages.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Our findings have implications for theory: They lead to a stronger focus on academic study time as the central key to positive academic outcomes, and a renewed focus on off-campus work as a major obstacle to positive academic outcomes. They suggest further that college and university administrators should find ways to "unplug" male students from their computer entertainments and to help minority students who need to work to find employment on campus.

AB Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a borderline condition between normal aging and dementia and is characterized by subjective complains of memory impairments that go beyond those expected considering age and education. Yet subjects are not demented, and their functional status remains intact (Peterson et al. 1999). It is suspected that this group includes a substantial number of patients with pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease(AD), since the follow-up of this group indicates a conversion rate from MCI to AD of 12 to 25% per year and 50% convert in 5 years. Normal controls by contrast, convert to AD on an average of 1-5% per year, depending on age. The identification of people at potential risk of dementia, could be helped by an early therapeutic intervention and also, it may lessen distress for both patient and family, minimize the risk of accidents, and perhaps even prevent the onset of the dementig process itself.
   Neuropsychological assessment is relevant to make a differential diagnosis between normal and pathological aging, to distinguish between different types of dementia, to define the patterns of strength and weakness and to suggest the likely pattern of underlying cerebral pathology The Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) is one of the recent neuroimaging techniques that contribute with information about the regional blood flow. Several studies of regional blood flow in AD patients demonstrate relative temporal and parietal hipoperfusion in AD. SPECT imaging conducted while the patient is engaged in a cognitive task or under sensory stimulation are referred to as activation studies. Activation studies afford unique opportunities to explore brain metabolic changes related to specific cognitive operations and to establish hypothesis of the neural networks supporting very discrete cognitive functions. Recent functional neuromiaging studies used during cognitive tasks have added to our understanding of the neural anatomy of cognition in both normal and pathological states; therefore the application of this technique to the study of patients with mild cognitive impairment could provide additional information for the earl), identification of this disease. Although activation studies have been used with EA, there are very few studies that have used activation methods to study MCI. Using SPECT, Riddle et al. (1993) studied ten patients with EA and nine age-matched normal controls with a verbal memory activation task and found significant differences between the groups only during the activation task.
   Since the differential diagnosis between normal aging, MCI and depression is still a matter of controversy, activation studies could provide objective data for the early and objective diagnosis of this group. We performed SPECT perfusion imaging during a basal and during a recognition verbal memory task in a group of normal and MCI subjects. Twenty-three subjects were studied ten controls and thirteen with MCI, matched by age and education. Patients and controls were not receiving psychotropic drugs. The Clinical Memory Unit and the Geriatric Service, of the Instituto Nacional de Nutricion Salvador Zubiran of Mexico City referred the subjects.
   The diagnosis of MCI was made if the patients met the following criteria: 1) memory complaint confirmed by a relative, 2) normal activities of daily living, 3) normal general cognitive function confirmed by Neuropsychological Testing, with scores within 1.00 to 1.5 deviation below the norms on the Brief Neuropsychological Test for Spanish Speaking Subjects (NEUROPSI) and on the NEUROPSI Attention and Memory Test, 4) not demented according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Fourth Edition, and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders of Association criteria respectively. Control subjects were chosen from the community population of individuals receiving general medical examination or among those who were related to patients. Patients and controls gave written consent.
   Neuropsychological assessment was carried out one week before the scanning. SPECT studies were carried out in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of The National Institute of Psychiatry with a Single Slice, multi-detector, three-head scanner (Siemmens) with 70 multiplexors per detector. Tc99m-ECD was used as tracer.
   Following the paradigm proposed by Riddle et al. (1993) a verbal memory task was implemented. Stimuli included:
   a) list of stimuli with "yes" "no", previously recorded by a feminine voice, with a rate of presentation of I each 5 seconds,
   b) a list of 10 high frequency words for Spanish language was presented for as many trials as required for five out of ten words to be recalled. The recognition component of the test was performed 5 minutes after,
   c) a recognition list which comprised 50 words -10 target-words repeated twice and at random, and 30 semantically and phonetically similar distractor words. Subjects were asked to respond "yes" or "no" according to whether they recognized the word. The recognition score was calculated by awarding +1 for a correct recognition, -1 for an incorrect recognition and 0 for a failed recognition. Maximum score was +20, the minimum -30.
   Each of the subjects was scanned on the same morning using a split-dose of Tc99m-ECD tracer. An in-dwelling intravenous catheter was inserted in an arm vein 15-20 minutes before the first injection of tracer (250 MBq). During injection and for five minutes afterwards, patients were reclining with eyes covered with patches and cars unplugged; background noise was minimal.
   For the baseline condition, the first injection of tracer was given over 30 seconds while subject repeated "yes" or "no" after the voice previously recorded, at a rate of I per second over 5 minutes beginning 1 minute before the injection. The subject was then scanned.
   For the activation condition, before the second injection of a tracer (again 250MBq) all subjects were given up to 5 presentations of the 10 word Est, until 5 words had been recalled. Beginning 15 seconds before the second injection of tracer, recognition of the 10 words from the 50 word recognition list was tested over 4 minutes at a rate of 1 word per 5 seconds. Subjects again responded "yes" (for a target word) or "no"(for a non-target word), so that simple verbal output was identical between the comparison conditions. Duration of each condition was approximately 15 minutes. State anxiety levels were assessed by administration of the Alderly Park State Anxiety Questionnaire (Walker, 1990) 5 minutes after each injection.
   The regions of interest that were analyzed included: In the lower cut: anterior cingulate, frontal, superior temporal, mid-temporal, posterior cingulate and occipital. In the upper cut: Anterior cingulate, frontal parietal, posterior cingulate and occipital, and the subcortical regions analyzed were: caudate, putamen and thalamus. The cerebellum was chosen for normalization. In each region pixel counts were performed. Activation indexes were calculated according to the following formula: Basal R=basal count/ basal cerebellum. Activation R=activation count-basal activation/basal cerebellum. Activation Index =(Activation R-Basal R)/(Activation R+ Basal R).
   The significance of changes in tracer uptake between baseline and activation conditions for individual regions of interest within each group was assessed using paired Student's t-tests. With the index obtain with the formula, a Student-T test for independent samples was used to compare MCI and control subjects.
   During the SPECT studies three cases with multinfarts were detected, and therefore were eliminated from the MCI sample.
   No significant differences were found in the learning of the word list, the control group had an average of 9.2 (1.2) out of 10 words, and the MCI obtained an average of 9.0 (1.0) out of 10 words. The control group achieved a recall of five words within five presentations and the MCI group within the seventh presentation. Nevertheless no significant differences were found in the recognition list. Performance list was more variable and with higher rate of errors in the MCI group than controls.
   Control subjects showed significant increases in uptake during the recognition tasks in several regions, including: In the lower cut: right anterior cingulate, right and left superior temporal, mid-temporal, left posterior cingulate. In the upper cut: right parietal, right posterior cingulate, right and left putamen, right thalamus. The MCI subjects showed differences in several subcortical structures including the right and left thalamus and left caudate nucleus in the lower cut.
   A great deal of interest has been generated concerning the topic of a boundary or transitional state between normal aging and dementia of the Alzheimer type. This condition has received several descriptors including mild cognitive impairment, incipient dementia, and isolated memory impairment. Although the criteria for MCI have been accepted, the operalization of these criteria can be challenging. In the present study, although no significant differences were found in the total learning of the word list, and differences were related to the rate of learning, the control group achieved a recall of five words within five presentations and the MCI group within the seventh presentation. During the SPECT activation task, significant differences between groups were found specifically in subcortical regions. Regional blood flow is tightly coupled to local neural demands for glucose. Changes in the pattern of regional cerebral perfusion thus provide an index of cerebral metabolic activity. At baseline, uptake tracer was almost identical in MCI subjects and controls whereas during the activation task the control subjects showed significant activation effects while MCI showed hipoperfusion of several subcortical structures including the left thalamus and caudate nucleus. Similar findings were reported by Riddle et al. (1993) who found bilateral activation of the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate and left parietal in normal controls but not in patients with AD during the same recognition memory task. In previous studies of regional glucose metabolism with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), subcortical abnormalities appear to precede cognitive impairment. It suggests that a gradual phase of neuronal degeneration can be detected and preced clinical diagnosis by many years. It has been reported that there exists a period of several years between detectable disease and clinical diagnosis; this offers the possibility of therapeutic intervention at a stage when most cognitive functions are still preserved. Therefore it opens the possibility for disease onset to be postponed or perhaps even avoided. The dividing line between normal physiological evolution and disease will continue to be difficult to define, and although this is a transversal study with a very small sample, results are encouraging since by performing it together with the neuropsychological testing SPECT studies, it might help to identify preclinical stages of dementia.
