AB Our Computer science k-12 education research group the educational toy company Quercetti have been collaborating together to design and manufacture toys that help stimulate and consolidate so-called computational thinking. This approach has been inspired by methods already consolidated in the literature and widespread worldwide such as the Bebras tasks and CS-Unplugged. This paper describes two of these smart toys, their design process, some evaluation's results, and finally feedback and reviews from buyers. The main activities proposed by these toys leverage visual coding through small colored physical items (e.g., pegs and balls) to deliver the unplugged activities to young users.

AB Within the field of social reintegration and re-education, this paper presents an educational experience carried out at the Iquitos Penitentiary Center, Lima, Peru, with the aim of providing an introduction to informatics to 25 inmates who volunteered to take part in the project. Twenty students and a teacher from the Scientific University of the South also in Peru, were responsible for initiating the transmission of knowledge from the university to inmates, with the collaboration and participation of the penitentiary coordinator. The main objectives of the case study were to validate both the suitability of the CS unplugged proposal and the adaptability of the L2T2L pedagogic strategy to the transmission of knowledge to adults, specifically penitentiary inmates. This strategy had been originally designed to transmit informatics knowledge from university to primary school. The validity and effectiveness of the experience was assessed using surveys. Results confirm that inmates achieved a good level of understanding when endeavoring to resolve most of the CS unplugged assignments designed for them. It was also seen that L2T2L is adaptable and valid for different scenarios other than those for which it was initially designed. Indeed, it was proven to be valid for transmitting knowledge to the prison population. Finally, it should be pointed out that the experience is easily replicable and that it brings an opportunity to introduce informatics into education programs in prisons, something which can contribute enormously to social reintegration and re-education, facilitating the subsequent reentry of inmates into the community once their period of imprisonment has ended.

AB With CS Unplugged activities, children all across the world can learn fundamental CS concepts without the requirement of learning how to program first. In the target article, the authors show the connection between CS Unplugged, on the one hand, and constructionism and computational thinking, on the other hand. They do so by providing a mapping between three CS Unplugged activities, Papert's constructionism, and six elements characterizing computational thinking. Here we reflect on what computational thinking is, how it is related to CS Unplugged, and how the CS Unplugged approach can be deepened in order to explore the full potential of constructionism.

AB This paper introduces an educational method for programming languages, applying the CS Unplugged concept. CS Unplugged is a methodology of teaching information science without using any computers through its educational steps, and it is said to be effective in teaching information science. We made a CS Unplugged-based lesson plan for an image processing algorithm using the Java language. The plan includes the following steps. First, a paper-and-pencil game activity is conducted without using any computers (CS Unplugged-step). Second, the paper-and-pencil game is simulated on Web browsers of computers using Java applets (CS Plugged-step). Third, the image processing procedure is described using natural language. Then, a flowchart of the procedure is drawn, and finally Java source code is written. We applied this method to students of a national institute of technology.

AB We teach computer programming to students aged 17 through 18 years. The course is structured into two units, with the first and second term each consisting of two 90-minute sessions per week conducted over 30 weeks. The course combines lectures with practical exercises. Every year we conduct a survey following the first term of two 90-minute sessions per week held over 30 weeks. The survey's results show that not a few students consider themselves to have insufficient understanding of programming or think that they are not good at programming. In response, we adopted and implemented a part of the Computer Science Unplugged (CS Unplugged) method, which is considered an effective way of teaching information science. However, although CS Unplugged has generated considerable results in motivating students to learn and in initial learning, we feel that it is not sufficiently connected to full-fledged programming languages such as C and Java. Accordingly, we propose a new method of advancing from CS Unplugged to full-fledged programming. The proposed method begins with conducting a CS Unplugged activity, and then continues on to the writing of a program on the same theme and further to its abstraction in Java. In this paper, we describe the thinking and concepts behind this proposed method.

AB Computer Science (CS) Unplugged activities have been deployed in many informal settings to present computing concepts in an engaging manner. To justify use in the classroom, however, it is critical for activities to have a strong educational component. For the past three years, we have been developing and refining a CS Unplugged curriculum for use in middle school classrooms. In this paper, we describe an assessment that maps questions from a comprehensive project to computational thinking (CT) skills and Bloom's Taxonomy. We present results from two different deployments and discuss limitations and implications of our approach.

AB Computer Science (CS) unplugged is a set of learning activities designed to explain CS concepts without using a computer. These activities have been used globally especially during CS outreach programs. It was used during these programs to attract middle and high school students to major in CS. With this knowledge in mind, we initiated a summer camp program involving local middle and high school girls using newly developed CS unplugged activities. The aim of these activities was to teach and simplify key programming concepts; we named these activities Programming Unplugged (PU). The set of activities developed focused on simplifying programming for newcomers. We had measured the success of the activities and the camp using surveys, and projects developed by the students. The result shows that the students have enjoyed the camp and will likely recommend it to their friends. Also, we noticed that most of the CS concepts introduced during PU activities were used in the student's projects.

ID VIEWPOINT
AB Context. The meaning and implications of "computational thinking" (CT) are only now starting to be clarified, and the applications of the Computer Science (CS) Unplugged approach are becoming clearer as research is appearing. Now is a good time to consider how these relate, and what the opportunities and issues are for teachers using this approach. Problem. The goal here is to connect computational thinking explicitly to the CS Unplugged pedagogical approach, and to identify the context where Unplugged can be used effectively. Method. We take a theoretical approach, selecting a representative sample of CS Unplugged activities and mappingthem to CT concepts. Results - The CS Unplugged activities map well onto commonly accepted CT concepts, although caution must be taken not to regard CS Unplugged as being a complete approach to CT education. Canstructivist content. A constructivist approach to teaching computer science concepts can be particularly valuable at present because the public (and many teachers who are likely to have to become engaged with the subject) do not see CS as something they are likely to understand. Providing a clear way for anyone to construct this knowledge for themselves gives an opportunity to empower them when it might otherwise have been regarded as a domain that is open to only a select few.

AB Due to its great importance in the media, the start-up world and the political discussion, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly relevant as a topic for schools. Until now, approaches to making AI tangible for students without actually programming an AI system have been rare. To address this circumstance, a teaching sequence of unplugged activities about AI has been developed and is presented. AI Unplugged provides CS Unplugged activities that present the ideas and concepts of computer science without using computers. The activities shed light on important concepts of AI and make it possible to convey the central ideas of artificial intelligence to the students. In addition, they offer starting points for discussing social issues around AI. This article describes the activities and their theoretical background, outlines a possible course of instruction, and describes practical experiences with AI Unplugged.

AB In the era where digital technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent, it is anticipated that a majority of the global population will have at least a basic understanding of informatics. However, empirical evidence suggests that a significant portion of the global population remains digitally illiterate. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the case of the senior adult population. In light of the aforementioned challenges, this work integrates Computer Science Unplugged exercises, based on games and recreational activities without the use of computers, and L2T2L, a learning-by-teaching methodology whereby university students learn and then, in turn, teach that learning to other populations in a cascading manner. A case study was conducted in Lima, Peru, with the participation of 140 volunteers from centres for the elderly. Thirty-five students and one teacher from the Universidad Cient & iacute;fica del Sur were responsible for initiating the transfer of knowledge from the university to the senior citizens, with the assistance of twelve individuals responsible for their care. The results demonstrate that the participants attained a commendable level of comprehension when attempting to complete all of the assigned tasks. Furthermore, the efficacy of L2T2L is evident in its adaptability and suitability for scenarios beyond those for which it was originally designed.

AB An intervention using the unplugged programming and storytelling (UPS) strategy was implemented in this study to cultivate students' programming learning motivation and concepts. The participants were 49 second graders at a primary school in southern Taiwan. The course was conducted for 12 lessons (40 min each lesson). A quasi-experimental design was employed in this study. During the course, students in the experimental group were taught using the UPS strategy. Data collection included the Programming Concept Test and Programming Learning Motivation Scale supplemented by classroom observation and interview data. The results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the comparison group in programming learning motivation and concepts after the course with the UPS strategy. This teaching experiment obtained large effect sizes. Interviews showed that students perceived positively, which helped them develop their programming concepts. The implication is that the UPS strategy may contribute to primary school programming courses.

AB Magic tricks based on computer science concepts help grab student attention and can motivate them to delve more deeply. Error detection ideas long used by computer scientists provide a rich basis for working magic; probably the most well known trick of this type is one included in the CS Unplugged activities. This paper shows that much more powerful variations of the trick can be performed, some in an unplugged environment and some with computer assistance. Some of the tricks also show off additional concepts in computer science and discrete mathematics.

AB Integrating computer science (CS) into school curricula has become a worldwide preoccupation. Therefore, we present a CS and Robotics integration model and its validation through a large-scale pilot study in the administrative region of the Canton Vaud in Switzerland. Approximately 350 primary school teachers followed a mandatory CS continuing professional development program (CPD) of adapted format with a curriculum scaffolded by instruction modality. This included CS Unplugged activities that aim to teach CS concepts without the use of screens, and Robotics Unplugged activities that employed physical robots, without screens, to learn about robotics and CS concepts. Teachers evaluated positively the CPD and their representation of CS improved. Voluntary adoption rates reached 97% during the CPD and 80% the following year. These results combined with the underpinning literature support the generalisability of the model to other contexts.

AB Computational Thinking is one of the necessary skills for children who live in modern times. Therefore, in this research, we aim to design lesson that can cultivate Computational Thinking. In this research, design a lesson that cultivates Computational Thinking by moving a robot to the specified finger state using a finger robot. At that time the children can know that by using the notion of "binary" you can count many numbers by bending and extending your fingers. By using a finger robot, it is thought that children will motivate themselves to teach and to understand easily.

AB Introducing computational thinking at elementary school can develop students' capabilities and interest in Computing skills. In this study, we introduced the Computer Science unplugged (CS-unplugged) technique in Pakistan. We use paper-based activities to equip students with basic Computer Science skills without introducing any programming language. This study contributes twofold: First, we report the impact of CS-Unplugged training on more than 350 elementary students. The empirical study reveals that the students perform better in solving problems after unplugged training. Improved results in the post-training activity support this impact. Second, we applied machine learning to predict students' performance. We employed different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the students' performance. Our results indicate that the Logistic regression-based model can predict the positive response of the student with a 0.91 receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). This pilot study results encourage introducing unplugged techniques at elementary schools in third-world countries. The goal is to have minimal changes in infrastructure and focus on better student learning. In the future, we plan to introduce more unplugged problem-solving techniques to elementary students by providing little training to the science or math teacher.

AB This special session explores the use of magic tricks based on computer science ideas; magic tricks help grab students' attention and can motivate them to invest more deeply in underlying CS concepts. Error detection ideas long used by computer scientists provide a particularly rich basis for working such "magic", with a CS Unplugged parity check activity being a notable example. Prior work has shown that one can perform much more sophisticated tricks than the relatively well-known CS Unplugged activity, and these tricks can motivate analyses across a wide variety of computer science concepts and are relevant to learning objectives across grade levels from 2nd grade through graduate school. These tricks have piqued the interest of past audiences and have been performed with the aid of online implementations; this conference session will demonstrate enhanced implementations used to illuminate the underlying concepts rather than just to perform the tricks. The audience will participate in puzzling out how to apply relevant concepts as we work through a scaffolded series of tricks centering on error detection and correction. The implementations also provide a useful model for incorporating greater interaction than is typically found in current innovative online interactive textbooks. In addition, they are samples for possible programming assignments that can motivate students using CS Unplugged activities to actively pursue deep programming experiences.

AB Children and adolescents consume increasing hours of screen time, the largest share of which goes to viewing movies according to Common Sense Research. Recently, movies with the highest box office revenues typically feature computer-generated imagery (CGI). Despite this substantial consumption of computer-generated imagery, the typical young viewer is unaware of how large a role mathematics plays in creating these movies. Studies have shown that there is a link between proficiency in math and predicted success in computing. In this paper, we describe our efforts to develop and evaluate CS Unplugged and code-based activities that attempt to explicitly connect math concepts with the creation of movie special effects magic. The learning activities have been designed and evaluated with middle school and first-year college students to demonstrate their potential to increase awareness and knowledge of how math is used in movie effects and to increase desire for future study of math. The paper describes the motivating context, pedagogical strategies, math learning outcomes, and CS Unplugged and code-based activities so that others may apply the methods. The paper concludes with a presentation and analysis of results from a five-day STEM summer camp for middle-school children and activities presented in first-year college classrooms and discussion of limitations and directions for future work.

ID PERCEPTIONS
AB Many students hold incorrect views of what computer science (CS) is, and they have negative attitudes towards the field. In order to address these difficulties, a series of learning activities called Computer Science Unplugged was developed by Bell et al. [3]. These activities expose young people to central concepts in CS in an entertaining way, without requiring a computer. Using questionnaires and interviews, we examined the effect of the activities on middle-school students' views of CS, specifically, on their views of: (a) the nature of CS; (b) the characteristics of computer scientists and work in CS; (c) the variety of employment in CS. The results indicate that-although the students generally understood what CS is-they perceived the computer as the essence of CS and not primarily as a tool, contrary to the intention of the CS Unplugged activities. We suggest additions to the activities intended to increase the change in the views of CS that students have.

AB Through meticulous analysis and adaptation, we reshaped unplugged computer science activities to align with the developmental needs and capabilities of primary school children. Our approach focuses on distilling the essence of computer science topics while tailoring their content and delivery methods to suit the younger audience. We describe our efforts and report on our experiences implementing our framework for eight primary school classes, turning our unplugged computer science workshops for secondary school classes into an educational playground for 192 primary school children. Our work contributes to the general societal mission of supporting more and more children to become interested in STEM, ensuring that our technological future is as diverse as possible.

AB Quantum computing is aninterdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science, and finds applications in areas including optimization, machine learning, and simulation of chemical, physical, and biological systems. It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9-12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.

AB Programming skills are an important component of an engineering curriculum, not only because they enable the customization of software tools to be used in the profession, but also (and perhaps more crucially) because of the "computational thinking" and problem solving capabilities that are ideally developed by young students who learn to program for the first time. The necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in Computer Science (CS)) it is well-documented in literature [1], as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org. This work presents an educational approach to teaching initial programming based on the development of fundamental and transversal skills and computer science skills, including creative and computational thinking as well as problem solving and critical thinking. The approach is based on cutting-edge educational tools, namely the visual programming frameworks Scratch, AppInventor, BYOB, and the well-known C/C++ language; curriculum material is drawn from CSPrinciples pilot courses, CS unplugged, school level preparation material for the International Olympiad in Informatics, and are complemented by supplementary information. The pedagogical approaches used in the course are based on constructivist learning theory, experiential learning and guided inquiry. This paper presents a year-long teaching experience in a 10th/13th grade high school with 14 to 16-year-old students. Ways to extend the experience to a university course are also presented. An initial analysis of the course results, both qualitative (based on two student surveys) and quantitative (based on formal written examinations) is presented and discussed. Results are encouraging, showing how visual programming languages help students to improve their problems solving skills and reasoning practices. Exposing the younger generation to computational concepts is fundamental in order to improve the mastering of these concepts and increase the success rate in university studies.

DE education; computer science unplugged; program counter
AB Computer science unplugged (CS unplugged) is a method of teaching computer science and computational thinking. The aim of our study is to illustrate program behavior and to prevent confusion about the program stack through visualization. To facilitate recognition, we used a toy consisting of a ball, pipes, and magnetic panels. The ball represents which line of code is executed, similar to the program counter. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present three examples based on the proposed method. The examples are necessity of loop to wait user input, necessity of loop to keep program running, and software testing. We conducted an experiment with nine participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result suggested that the proposed method is expected to be effective.

AB Educational Robotics (ER) has the potential to provide significant benefits to education, provided an increase in outreach by transitioning from the extra-curricular initiatives in which ER has thrived to formal education. As Computer Science (CS) Education is undergoing curricular reforms worldwide, the present study addresses the case of a Digital Education reform that included ER as a means to teach core CS concepts. Approximately 350 teachers from the first four grades of primary school participated in a mandatory two-year continuing professional development (CPD) program. The first year of the program was dedicated to CS and introduced teachers to CS Unplugged (CSU) and Robotics Unplugged (RU) activities. As such, we analyse the interplay between these activities and focus on teachers' voluntary adoption of the proposed content in classrooms. This is complemented by an analysis of their perception and recommendation of ER. The findings highlight three main points. Firstly, ER benefits from the integration in the CS CPD, as this provides the necessary traction to introduce ER into teacher practices (the teachers freely devoted 2275 h to ER activities in their classrooms, over two years). Secondly, the presence of ER activities in the CS-CPD allows a higher proportion of teachers to adopt the CS content, as there are teachers that favour one type of activity over the other. Finally, the globally positive perception of ER registered in this study is relevant for two reasons: teachers were not voluntarily participating in the CPD, and results did not differ between pioneers and novices.

DE diversity; K-12 education; outreach; assessment
AB The desire to expose more students to computer science has led to the development of a plethora of educational activities[16, 7, 15, 4] and outreach programs to broaden participation in computer science. Despite extensive resources (time and money), they have made little impact on the diversity of students pursuing computer science. To realize large gains, computational thinking must be integrated into K-12 systems, starting with elementary school. In order to do so, existing resources need to be adapted for a school setting.
   In order to make a curriculum with lessons that build on each other over several years, and accountability for student learning, we need standards, an understanding of how students learn, and identification of what students know before exposure to the curriculum.
   In this paper, we present our detailed findings of what fourth graders know before encountering a computational thinking curriculum. Groups of students participated in activities modified from CS Unplugged[4] in order to discover their knowledge (rather than provide instruction). We identify aspects of the activities students were able to complete successfully, and where they will need further instruction. We then explain how we used these results to modify our pilot curriculum.

AB Contribution: Adaptation and application of a methodology to introduce Informatics from an early age to students living in disadvantaged areas in Peru and analysis of its effects.Background: On the on hand, during the COVID-19 pandemic, students living in disadvantaged areas in Peru were confined to their home under the supervision of their family and without access to computers. On the other hand, the multistage sequencing knowledge transmission methodology (L2T2L), first proposed in JolasMATIKA (Basque Country), to introduce Informatics topics using CS Unplugged from university to school had shown to be effective.Research Question: Does the introduction from an early age into Informatics affect the appreciation of students living in disadvantaged areas about what Informatics is and their attitude toward it? Is the methodology used appropriate for times of pandemic?Methodology: A pilot project based on the L2T2L methodology was introduced at the Public School of the Religious Association Br. Thomas Helm S.M. (Peru) for primary and secondary education during the 2020/2021 pandemic academic year. University engineering students from the UTEC University were in charge of initiating the transmission of Informatics concepts to teachers of secondary and primary education who transmitted the knowledge to their respective students, using mobile phones. Surveys were used to gather data at the beginning and the end of the experience.Findings: A methodology adequate for introducing Informatics from an early age and for reducing the digital divide between technologically advanced communities and more disadvantaged communities. Students and family unit members changed their opinion about Informatics.

AB Quantum computing is an emerging field that can revolutionize our ability to solve problems and enable breakthroughs in many areas including optimization, machine learning, chemistry, and drug design. With the increasing computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing increases significantly. The theory of quantum computing lies at the crossroads of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. The field of quantum computing has matured and can now be explored by all students. While today, quantum computers and simulators are readily accessible and programmable over the internet, quantum computing education is just ramping up. This paper describes our experiences in organizing and delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students with little or no experience in the above-mentioned fields. We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed "unplugged" activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. Overall, we take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Q Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our experiences and findings suggest that basic quantum computing concepts are palatable for high-school students, and-due to significant differences between classical and quantum computing-early exposure to quantum computing is a valuable addition to the set of problem-solving and computing skills that high-schoolers obtain before entering university.

AB First-order logic (FO) is an important foundation of many domains, such as mathematics, philosophy, computer science and artificial intelligence. Currently, there is a growing interest in teaching computer science concepts and computational thinking to children, such as through Scratch [5], Blockly [3] or CS Unplugged [1]. One topic which appears to be curiously understudied, however, is that of teaching of FO. Indeed, FO is not only important in CS and AI, but learning FO can also help children in a variety of other disciplines by sharpening their reasoning skills. While Kowalski and colleagues already saw the potential of teaching Prolog in 1980 [4], not many tools or applications have been published for teaching any form of logic since then. This is due to a number of issues that may make teaching FO difficult: (1) logic has a steep learning curve, (2) it does not "do" anything, and (3) it is not fun due to the lack of graphics, animations and sounds. In our work, we overcome these objections by designing an appropriate learning environment. The focus of this environment is twofold: a child-friendly representation for FO, combined with a fun and engaging task to solve.

AB Being able to teach students about CS concepts effectively is a growing priority in primary schools. Teachers need to develop not just their content knowledge but also best-practice pedagogical approaches. Direct observation is one way of evaluating new teaching methods, but research with video/screen capture is typically time-consuming and difficult to get quick insights from. In this study we explore using 3D virtual worlds to quickly collect richer information from students working on an educational activity in a simulated 3D environment such as Second Life.
   We report on a case study exploring the insights that could be gleaned from this data collection, and compare how students learned in a 3D virtual world with simpler 2D map-based versions of a CS Unplugged problem-solving activity. The activity chosen was initially designed for physical use, and did not intrinsically favour either computer-based environment.
   Students using the 2D condition found a non-optimal solution faster, but the amount of extra time taken to find the optimal solution was similar to the 3D condition, and students had similar post-test scores in both conditions. Students using the 3D condition appeared to choose their actions more carefully, reflecting the higher physical load and slower response times of the virtual world environment. More students thought the 3D activity was fun and would choose to do again, and reported that it felt more like they were learning.
   While authoring tools are improving, virtual world content can still be challenging to develop and deploy. Care is needed to design engaging activities, and avoid creating environments that are immersive but a poor fit for learning.

AB In today's technology-dominated world, in order to better equip the next generation of youth with technological skills suitable for future jobs, pre-tertiary and early tertiary curricula are being significantly revamped all over the world. In line with this drive, as a STEM discipline, Computer Science (CS) is also being widely incorporated in recent curricular initiatives. Information security is one of core areas of CS. Security concepts often entail esoteric mathematical ideas which are difficult to explain to early-stage learners, which necessitates contriving new and engaging ways of teaching. This paper deals with teaching of one such security concept - namely, Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol - to early-stage learners. Traditionally, a color-mixing analogy has been used for introducing the concept of Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. Although this approach elegantly exemplifies the discrete logarithm problem on which the protocol is based, depending on how the lesson is executed, it can be passive, or require a new supply of liquid colors for each lesson. Therefore, we have developed a digital version of the color-mixing approach - while retaining active student participation and tangibility - by using color sensors and Raspberry Pi. We also propose a mission-based lesson plan based on the tangible tool for enabling young pupils to comprehend difficult concepts. Our pilot study using the tangible-tool-based lesson plan showed promising results as the participants found the lesson engaging and enriching. We also believe, as an unplugged approach, our low-cost and reusable tangible tool can help ensure universal access to education in developing countries.

AB Intrinsic Motivation Inventory is a self-report instrument used to assess participants' experience regarding a particular activity. This paper examined the psychometric properties of a revised Intrinsic Motivation Inventory in the context of computational thinking learning. A total of 400 students from 4th grade participated in the pilot study. The revised instrument measured students' intrinsic motivation from four dimensions: interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, value/usefulness, and relatedness. The main findings of the study are twofold: (1) primary school students showed moderate to high motivation to learn computational thinking through programming and CS Unplugged; (2) factor analysis revealed that single factor model and multifactor model had good fit indices. However, discriminant validity of multifactor model was poor, suggesting the existence of a general factor.

AB In order to meet the cybersecurity workforce demand, it is important to raise cybersecurity interest among the youth. Just like ACM programming competitions, Capture the Flag ( CTF) competitions allow students to learn cybersecurity skills in a fun and engaging way. It is an effective platform to increase students' interest in cybersecurity and prepare them for defending against real cyber attackers. A typical CTF competition requires at least some basic technical security knowledge and months of diligent preparation. For this very reason, many computer science students do not feel qualified to participate in CTF competitions, and as a result, do not even try. To overcome this lack of confidence while at the same time raising awareness about the cybersecurity profession in a realistic fashion, we have developed the CTF Unplugged project, as inspired by the CS Unplugged project. The primary goal is to teach students with little or no technical knowledge about the different cybersecurity challenges that a cybersecurity professional must address and the problem-solving skills needed for a cybersecurity career, all without direct use of technology. The effectiveness of CTF unplugged project has been evaluated after exposing 36 high school students participating in the Tennessee Tech University GenCyber Camp to these activities this past summer. Students reported a significant gain in knowledge, confidence and comfort level after participation.

AB This experience report describes an approach for helping elementary schools integrate computational thinking and coding by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure that do not rely on 1-1 computing. A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon "unplugged" knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by pre-and post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB With the introduction of Computer Science (CS) into curricula worldwide, researchers have investigated whether CS could be introduced transversally, as a support other disciplines. Few however consider both student learning and the teachers' perspective in their assessments. In a co-constructive approach to translational research, we collaborated with teachers, in two case studies involving two classes each, to investigate how CS content could be used transversally. More specifically, teacher inputs and student learning data were combined in a mixed methods analysis to determine whether two CS Unplugged (CSU) activities from the curriculum could be leveraged to teach disciplinary content in primary school. The findings indicated that the CSU activities could be leveraged for maths and spelling, but require validation at a larger scale. More important, though, are the takeaways of the co-constructive experience with teachers. Interestingly the benefits of co-construction went both ways. While researchers gained a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the activities, teachers i) appreciated having detailed student learning analyses, devoid of biases and impressions, ii) changed their perspective about researchers, and iii) were open to other collaborative research initiatives which they found to be drivers of change and innovation in their practice. The way co-construction was approached also impacted the teachers' perception of their experience. Indeed, while one study was researcher-driven and included teachers, the other was teacher-driven and included researchers. When teacher-driven, the teachers felt they had a more active role, thus reflecting more on the study design, results and implications. Provided the positive impact that co-construction may have on innovation in teacher practices, different co-construction modalities must be investigated, as well as their implications on all stakeholders, including researchers.

ID EFFICACY
AB The integration of practice-related aspects in pre-service informatics teacher education is an essential part in future teachers' qualifications. To further promote opportunities for teaching-practice into our teacher-preparation programs, we recently introduced a teaching-learning-laboratories (TLL) for informatics in Karlsruhe, Germany. This TLL not only offers pre-service informatics teachers students the opportunity to gain practical teaching experience, but we also promote competencies of secondary school pupils in workshops for school classes. In the laboratory, pre-service informatics teacher students can practice in micro-teaching learning scenarios both in seminars and in workshops with school classes. Based on this, we developed teaching-learning strategies as a combination of unplugged and plugged teaching-learning activities. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the workshops, they are also subject of an evaluation, examining the TLL from the perspective of the workshop concepts for pre-service informatics teacher students and the schools' pupils. From these two perspectives we investigate different fields of interest with the common goal to establish an effective TLL. In this paper we describe our approach of the TLL, our first experiences with workshops we have already conducted as well as the framework and the concept for evaluation.

AB In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.
   It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.
   In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner's mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner's mental model to a full NM.

AB We apply the notion of 'semantic waves' from Legitimation Code Theory (LCT), a powerful educational framework, to Computer Science Education. We consider two case studies exploring how a simple analysis can help improve learning activities. The case studies focus on unplugged activities used in the context of both teaching school students and teacher continuing professional development. We used a simple method based on LCT to analyse the activities in terms of their 'semantic profiles': changes in the context-dependence and complexity of the knowledge being taught. This led to improvements to the activities. We argue that 'semantic waves', or moves back and forth between concrete/simpler and abstract/complex knowledge, help show ways that an unplugged activity might be effective or not, and how small changes to the activities can make a difference in potentially offering a more fruitful learning experience.

AB The demand to incorporate informatics into primary education is seen as a critical necessity both today, and for the future of modern societies. Numerous countries are currently revising their primary education curricula in order to incorporate informatics concepts and computational thinking skills. Although many successful initiatives have been implemented, countries commonly encounter shared obstacles related to teacher competence development, concept selection, learning content design, and the pedagogical approaches employed. This study explored the effectiveness of three pedagogical approaches on primary school students' learning of informatics concepts. Mixed-method research with a concurrent embedded design in the form of a quasi-experimental study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the three pedagogical approaches (two unplugged: role-play, hands-on, and one plugged: technology-mediated). A total of 55 fourth-grade students participated in the intervention where the instructional content focused on the core five concepts of informatics in primary school through 15 activities. Based on students' pretest and posttest results, as well as their reflections, unique advantages and drawbacks of the three pedagogical approaches were revealed. Gender differences according to the results, reflections, and pedagogical approaches were each investigated. Although variations were noted in task completion and reflective outcomes, it is a crucial to recognise that the effectiveness of any approach may be contingent upon other contextual factors. The findings of this study are significant in terms of the potential influence of various pedagogical approaches on future educational practices, as well as policies for instructional designers at the primary school level.

AB In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.

AB Circulatory system is a challenging subject for middle school students to learn and understand conceptual relationships. To address these challenges, this study developed plugged (computational thinking activities using computer) and unplugged (computational thinking activities without using computer) teaching modules that integrated computational thinking components into the circulatory system topic. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of these teaching modules on the conceptual learning and computational thinking skills of 6th grade students. A quasi-experimental design was employed with experimental group 1 using plugged instructional modules, experimental group 2 using unplugged instructional modules and the control group following an inquiry-based constructivist approach aligned with the Turkish science curriculum. These interventions were implemented over a period of 16 lesson hours (4 weeks) for all three groups. The researchers used the Circulatory System Conceptual Learning and Computational Thinking Skills Scale (CSCL-CTSS) as a data collection tool. The results of the study indicated that both experimental group 1 (n = 30) and experimental group 2 (n = 30) showed significantly higher success in circulatory system conceptual learning and computational thinking skills compared to the control group (n = 30). Therefore, this experimental study provides a concrete example of integrating computational thinking into science teaching and presents innovative educational approaches that can enhance the learning of challenging science concepts. Furthermore, it compares the effectiveness of these innovative educational approaches (plugged and unplugged implementations) in developing conceptual learning and computational thinking skills.

AB As conversational AI apps such as Siri and Alexa become ubiquitous among children, the CS education community has begun leveraging this popularity as a potential opportunity to attract young learners to AI, CS, and STEM learning. However, teaching conversational AI to K-12 learners remains challenging and unexplored due in part to the abstract and complex nature of some conversational AI concepts, such as intents and training phrases. One promising approach to teaching complex topics in engaging ways is through unplugged activities, which have been shown to be highly effective in fostering CS conceptual understanding without using computers. Research efforts are underway toward developing unplugged activities for teaching AI, but few thus far have focused on conversational AI. This experience report describes the design and iterative refinement of a series of novel unplugged activities for a conversational AI summer camp for middle school learners. We discuss learner responses and lessons learned through our implementation of these unplugged activities. Our hope is that these insights support CS education researchers in making conversational AI learning more engaging and accessible to all learners.

AB This study proposed plugged and unplugged approaches for young students to simultaneously improve their interdisciplinary learning performance in English and Computational Thinking (CT). The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students' English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students' foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach. This research provides an innovation development and evaluation for plugged and unplugged approaches.

AB We introduced "Computer Science Unplugged" to our classes in junior and senior high schools. "Unplugged" is an education method of computer science without students using a computer at all. For our classes, we developed original teaching materials and methods for Unplugged. As a result, the students could learn the topics of computer science with interest by using Unplugged. They enjoyed the games in Unplugged and thought about the topics deeply at the same time. We confirmed that students enhanced their motivations, thinking abilities, and imaginations.

AB Learning programming in early introductory classes is challenging for first year university students, and introducing parallel programming (PDC) in early classes along with traditional sequential programming is even more challenging. Unplugged activities may help alleviate some of the difficulties for students. Unplugged activities have been shown to increase student interest, and to enhance student understanding of CS programming concepts [1]. We have used unplugged activities to teach PDC concepts before introducing parallel programming. Our experiences show that using unplugged activities to introduce the PDC concepts reduce the barrier to learn parallel programming.

AB Technological devices programmed through parallel computing are increasingly present in people's daily lives. They are responsible for processing images that we see on computers, televisions, cell phones and games. It is a fact that parallel processing is a reality, so computer professionals need to know the peculiarities of this form of programming. However, teaching parallel computing is not a simple task, the computational thinking parallel is quite different from that for the sequential processing. This work, then proposes a new methodology for teaching parallel computing for young beginners in programming. Our technique is based on principles of unplugged computing, like to learn doing and playing. We believe that unplugged computing can be very useful in teaching the difficult concepts of parallel computing(1).

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB Informatics or computer science1 contents are often considered as "difficult", at school as well as in University courses. This may be due to different reasons, e.g. to the topics themselves or to the way of teaching. What can be done in order to make it easier to understand for students of all ages? This paper about an Austrian project for primary and secondary schools - "Informatics - A Child's Play" shows one possible way: the use of games, animations and simulations. The project is partly based on successful projects like "Computer Science Unplugged" or "Informatik erLeben (Experiencing Informatics)". Like these initiatives, it teaches computer science topics in a playful way, where children slip into the role of hardware components, parts of programs or data. But, the new project "Informatics - A Child's Play" goes further: New teaching units and material are developed and, this is the essential novelty, the children themselves design and test games, quizzes, puzzles and riddles. Furthermore, they act as peer tutors or peer teachers and explain different topics to their classmates, to younger children as well as to elderly people. This paper describes the project, which is still in the pilot phase, as well as some experiences and results gained up to now.

AB The aim of this study is to compare the effects of unplugged and plugged-in activities on academic achievement and computational thinking (CT) skills of sixth-grade students. Mixed-method research was carried out to explore whether there were differences between the groups, and to learn the students' opinions and experiences regarding the practices. For the quantitative phase, a quasi-experimental design was used with two groups. For qualitative phase, 12 students were interviewed. The participants were 84 sixth-grade students (between the ages of 10 and 11). The intervention was designed on a selection/construction of activities from seven different basic programming web platforms for the plugged-in group and the proposed national curriculum unplugged activities for the unplugged group. The results showed that significant differences between groups in academic achievement favoring the unplugged activities, but not in CT skills. Development in CT skills contributed to the unplugged group's academic achievement. In addition, qualitative results showed that the plugged-in group perceived their activities as fun and entertaining, but not exactly like a lesson; in contrast, the unplugged group did not experience anxiety or boredom since they perceived the activities as educational. CT explained 27 percent of the variance in academic achievement, suggesting that this skill is important for academic achievement in basic programming. These results suggest that students can improve their academic achievement and maintain the level of CT acquisition across unplugged and plugged-in activities. This article contributes to the body of knowledge about the positive impact of unplugged activities on teaching CT and programming fundamentals.

AB We present a learning path on cryptography for primary school students (Grade 5), which we designed and tested. The project aims to raise initial awareness of the core ideas of modern cryptography, which are fundamental concepts for becoming informed and active citizens in modern digital society. For this reason, we designed a progression of unplugged activities (sometimes integrated with task-specific, block-based programming environments) to expose students to different cryptographic techniques, where each new activity is motivated by an analysis of the criticalities encountered previously. We used unplugged activities to show that Computer Science (CS) does not necessarily imply the use of digital devices and to allow students to focus on its general scientific principles. We describe the designed learning module, discuss the main hinges in the experiment, and reflect on the lessons learned. The final evaluation showed excellent learning outcomes and high satisfaction with the activities. As cryptography uses mathematical tools (e.g., modular arithmetic, statistics), some parts of which are within reach of primary school children but rarely taught to them, it was possible to dwell on these aspects, making them experience mathematical objects in a non-standard context, and also stimulating a greater awareness of the impact of mathematics and CS in everyday life.
